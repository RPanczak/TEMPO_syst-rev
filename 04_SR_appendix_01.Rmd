# Appendix 1: Search strategy

We searched four major databases of scientific literature: arXiv, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science. 

## arXiv 

arXiv was searched on the 21 December 2017 using web interface. We used all search terms defined in the main text. Since there was no possibility to set up automatic updates we monitored the source manually until the day of submission of the manuscript. 

## Google Scholar 

Google Scholar was searched between 8 and 9 November 2017 using Publish or Perish software (Harzing 2007, available from https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish). Due to very large amount of retried records we excluded search terms "working population",	"mobile population", "service population",	"floating population" and "seasonal population". We updated the search for the "spatiotemporal population" keyword on 29 November 2017. Because of the limitations of the data retrieval we searched for each of the keywords separately and limited the number of years of publication to achieve full coverage. The results were then monitored by scrutinizing email update service set up for each search. 

## Scopus

Scopus was searched on the 7 November 2017 using web interface. We searched for primary results and "secondary documents". We excluded subject areas not related to the topic ("Medicine", "Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology", "Chemistry", "Psychology", "Immunology and Microbiology"). We updated the search for the "spatiotemporal population" keyword on 24 November 2017. The results were then monitored by scrutinizing RSS service feed with updates for each search. 

## Web Of Science 

Web Of Science was searched on the 7 November 2017 using web interface. We searched for primary results and "secondary documents". We excluded categories not related to the topic ("TROPICAL MEDICINE", "NEUROSCIENCES", "PARASITOLOGY", "MATHEMATICS", "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES", "DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY", "MEDICINE RESEARCH EXPERIMENTAL", "MARINE FRESHWATER BIOLOGY", "BIOCHEMICAL RESEARCH METHODS", "HEALTH CARE SCIENCES SERVICES", "MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES", "SOIL SCIENCE", "BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION", "WATER RESOURCES", "VIROLOGY", "ZOOLOGY", "OPHTHALMOLOGY", "EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY", "FORESTRY", "IMMUNOLOGY", "OCEANOGRAPHY", "COMPUTER SCIENCE THEORY METHODS", "ENGINEERING CIVIL", "BIOLOGY", "PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH", "VETERINARY SCIENCES", "MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY", "ANATOMY MORPHOLOGY", "FISHERIES", "OPTICS", "PLANT SCIENCES", "BIOTECHNOLOGY APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY", "GEOSCIENCES MULTIDISCIPLINARY", "ORNITHOLOGY", "ONCOLOGY", "BIOCHEMISTRY MOLECULAR BIOLOGY", "IMAGING SCIENCE PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY", "GENETICS HEREDITY", "PHYSICS FLUIDS PLASMAS", "ENTOMOLOGY", "BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES", "CARDIAC CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEMS", "ORTHOPEDICS", "COMPUTER SCIENCE CYBERNETICS", "SPORT SCIENCES", "COMPUTER SCIENCE HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE", "AGRONOMY", "GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS", "MEDICAL INFORMATICS", "INFECTIOUS DISEASES", "BIOPHYSICS", "PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL", "PHYSIOLOGY", "LIMNOLOGY", "MECHANICS", "CHEMISTRY PHYSICAL", "ENGINEERING BIOMEDICAL", "NEUROIMAGING", "NANOSCIENCE NANOTECHNOLOGY", "ENGINEERING ELECTRICAL ELECTRONIC", "TOXICOLOGY", "PHYSICS CONDENSED MATTER", "COMPUTER SCIENCE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS", "CLINICAL NEUROLOGY", "CHEMISTRY MULTIDISCIPLINARY", "METEOROLOGY ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES", "PHYSICS ATOMIC MOLECULAR CHEMICAL", "REHABILITATION", "PSYCHOLOGY", "RADIOLOGY NUCLEAR MEDICINE MEDICAL IMAGING", "MEDICINE GENERAL INTERNAL", "ACOUSTICS", "MICROBIOLOGY", "AGRICULTURE MULTIDISCIPLINARY", "ENGINEERING MECHANICAL", "CELL BIOLOGY"). We updated the search for the "spatiotemporal population" keyword on 24 November 2017. The results were then monitored by scrutinizing RSS service feed with updates for each search.
