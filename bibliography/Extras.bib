  abstract = {Systematic reviews provide clinical practice recommendations that are based on evaluation of primary evidence. When systematic reviews with the same aims have different conclusions, it is difficult to ascertain which review reported the most credible and robust findings. This study examined five systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of Pilates exercise in people with chronic low back pain. A four-stage process was used to interpret findings of the reviews. This process included comparison of research questions, included primary studies, and the level and quality of evidence of systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the methodological quality of systematic reviews, using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence, and the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews respectively. Any disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. A high level of consensus was achieved between the reviewers. Conflicting findings were reported by the five systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of Pilates in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. Authors of the systematic reviews included primary studies that did not match their questions in relation to treatment or population characteristics. A total of ten primary studies were identified across five systematic reviews. Only two of the primary studies were included in all of the reviews due to different inclusion criteria relating to publication date and status, definition of Pilates, and methodological quality. The level of evidence of reviews was low due to the methodological design of the primary studies. The methodological quality of reviews varied. Those which conducted a meta-analysis obtained higher scores. There is inconclusive evidence that Pilates is effective in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This is due to the small number and poor methodological quality of primary studies. The Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews provides a useful method of appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Individual item scores, however, should be examined in addition to total scores, so that significant methodological flaws of systematic reviews are not missed, and results are interpreted appropriately.

  abstract = {There is long-standing scientific interest in understanding purposeful movement by animals and humans. Traditionally, collecting data on individual moving entities was difficult and time-consuming, limiting scientific progress. The growth of location-aware and other geospatial technologies for capturing, managing and analyzing moving objects data are shattering these limitations, leading to revolutions in animal movement ecology and human mobility science. Despite parallel transitions towards massive individual-level data collected automatically via sensors, there is little scientific cross-fertilization across the animal and human divide. There are potential synergies from converging these separate domains towards an integrated science of movement. This paper discusses the data-driven revolutions in the animal movement ecology and human mobility science, their contrasting worldviews and, as examples of complementarity, transdisciplinary questions that span both fields. We also identify research challenges that should be met to develop an integrated science of movement trajectories.},

Incremental advances in conventional review updating are unlikely to lead to substantial improvements in review currency. A new approach is needed. We propose living systematic review as a contribution to evidence synthesis that combines currency with rigour to enhance the accuracy and utility of health evidence. Living systematic reviews are high quality, up-to-date online summaries of health research, updated as new research becomes available, and enabled by improved production efficiency and adherence to the norms of scholarly communication. Together with innovations in primary research reporting and the creation and use of evidence in health systems, living systematic review contributes to an emerging evidence ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Despite its rising significance, research on temporary population mobility in the Developed World, remains sparse, fragmented, and largely descriptive in nature. If progress in understanding is to be made, it is argued that a more systematic approach to measuring the space-time dynamics of temporary mobility is needed. The problems and issues in measuring
temporary forms of movement are reviewed, and nine distinct facets of mobility are then
identified, each of which captures a particular aspect of mobility behaviour. Five of these that pertain to the temporal dimension of population movement are explored and a series of measures for each outlined and illustrated using data from the Australian Population Census
and the National Visitor Survey. Results reveal the interdependence of space-time measures,
delineate several outstanding measurement tasks and underline the need for more comprehensive data sources.},

  abstract = {In 1930, a time when human geography was not considered to be among the emerging analytic social sciences and when urban geography barely existed as an identifiable subfield, C. Warren Thornthwaite, later a gargantuan figure in American climatology, was awarded a doctorate under Carl O. Sauer at the University of California, Berkeley. In his dissertation, `Louisville, Kentucky: a study in urban geography', Thornthwaite analysed land-use zonation, commercial strip development, daytime\textendash{}night-time populations, community formation, elevation and land values, functional regions and cultural areas, spatial competition and optimal location, buying power and residential distribution. Thornthwaite's urban geography was centered unmistakably in the spatial tradition, and his innovative research \textendash{} based on aerial photographs, intensive field observations, city directories and detailed mapping \textendash{} treated concepts that were to become central to urban geography as it developed in the late 1950s and the 1960s. Urban geography, however, evolved independently of Thornthwaite's contributions. Thornthwaite directed no graduate students, and his unpublished dissertation was not cited until a perfunctory reference in 1954. A second citation, not appearing until almost 30 years later, described it as `a major synthesis'. Thornthwaite's dissertation was not only an anomaly in the career of its author but also an anachronism in the history of urban geography.},
