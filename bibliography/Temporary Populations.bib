  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a method for estimating seasonally specific ambient population counts. The central assumption is that the variation in observed night-lights is a valid proxy for ambient population. Island populations are used for validation, where it is possible to derive estimates of ambient population from national statistics. The method is then applied to the whole of Greece. The validation shows a strong correlation amongst night-lights derived estimates and the reference dataset. Based on the proposed method, national maps are produced showing the month when seasonality is in its peak, the peak value during that month and the overall length of the season, in terms of how many months exceed a certain threshold. Different seasonality patterns are revealed. An advantage of the proposed method, compared to other contemporary approaches, is that it is based on public domain, global data.},

  abstract = {Several attempts have already been made to use telecommunications networks for urban research, but the datasets employed have typically been neither dynamic nor fine grained. Against this research backdrop the mobile phone network offers a compelling compromise between these extremes: it is both highly mobile and yet still localisable in space. Moreover, the mobile phone's enormous and enthusiastic adoption across most socioeconomic strata makes it a uniquely useful toot for conducting large-scale, representative behavioural research. In this paper we attempt to connect telecoms usage data from Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) to a geography of human activity derived from data on commercial premises advertised through Pagine Gialle, the Italian 'Yellow Pages'. We then employ eigendecomposition-a process similar to factoring but suitable for this complex dataset-to identify and extract recurring patterns of mobile phone usage. The resulting eigenplaces support the computational and comparative analysis of space through the tens of telecommuniations usage and enhance our understanding of the city as a 'space of flows'.},

  volume = {Feb 24},
  abstract = {Introduction: Sudden impact disasters often result in the displacement of large numbers of people. These movements can occur prior to events, due to early warning messages, or take place post-event due to damages to shelters and livelihoods as well as a result of long-term reconstruction efforts. Displaced populations are especially vulnerable and often in need of support. However, timely and accurate data on the numbers and destinations of displaced populations are extremely challenging to collect across temporal and spatial scales, especially in the aftermath of disasters. Mobile phone call detail records were shown to be a valid data source for estimates of population movements after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, but their potential to provide near real-time ongoing measurements of population displacements immediately after a natural disaster has not been demonstrated. Methods: A computational architecture and analytical capacity were rapidly deployed within nine days of the Nepal earthquake of 25th April 2015, to provide spatiotemporally detailed estimates of population displacements from call detail records based on movements of 12 million de-identified mobile phones users. Results: Analysis shows the evolution of population mobility patterns after the earthquake and the patterns of return to affected areas, at a high level of detail. Particularly notable is the movement of an estimated 390,000 people above normal from the Kathmandu valley after the earthquake, with most people moving to surrounding areas and the highly-populated areas in the central southern area of Nepal. Discussion: This analysis provides an unprecedented level of information about human movement after a natural disaster, provided within a very short timeframe after the earthquake occurred. The patterns revealed using this method are almost impossible to find through other methods, and are of great interest to humanitarian agencies.},

  volume = {111},
  issn = {0027-8424},
  abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotem- poral distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estima- tions of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also dem- onstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applica- tions and a near real-time understanding of patterns and pro- cesses in human geography.},

  title = {Dynamic Denominators: {{The}} Impact of Seasonally Varying Population Numbers on Disease Incidence Estimates},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {14787954},
  abstract = {Reliable health metrics are crucial for accurately assessing disease burden and planning interventions. Many health indicators are measured through passive surveillance systems and are reliant on accurate estimates of denominators to transform case counts into incidence measures. These denominator estimates generally come from national censuses and use large area growth rates to estimate annual changes. Typically, they do not account for any seasonal fluctuations and thus assume a static denominator population. Many recent studies have highlighted the dynamic nature of human populations through quantitative analyses of mobile phone call data records and a range of other sources, emphasizing seasonal changes. In this study, we use mobile phone data to capture patterns of short-term human population movement and to map dynamism in population densities. We show how mobile phone data can be used to measure seasonal changes in health district population numbers, which are used as denominators for calculating district-level disease incidence. Using the example of malaria case reporting in Namibia we use 3.5 years of phone data to investigate the spatial and temporal effects of fluctuations in denominators caused by seasonal mobility on malaria incidence estimates. We show that even in a sparsely populated country with large distances between population centers, such as Namibia, populations are highly dynamic throughout the year. We highlight how seasonal mobility affects malaria incidence estimates, leading to differences of up to 30 \% compared to estimates created using static population maps. These differences exhibit clear spatial patterns, with likely overestimation of incidence in the high-prevalence zones in the north of Namibia and underestimation in lower-risk areas when compared to using static populations. The results here highlight how health metrics that rely on static estimates of denominators from censuses may differ substantially once mobility and seasonal variations are taken into account. With respect to the setting of malaria in Namibia, the results indicate that Namibia may actually be closer to malaria elimination than previously thought. More broadly, the results highlight how dynamic populations are. In addition to affecting incidence estimates, these changes in population density will also have an impact on allocation of medical resources. Awareness of seasonal movements has the potential to improve the impact of interventions, such as vaccination campaigns or distributions of commodities like bed nets.},

  abstract = {One of the most important and difficult problems now confronting city planners is the development of accurate, usable techniques for estimating the current daytime population of census tracts in metropolitan areas. Such estimates differ greatly from the population statistics known to planners in the past. They per- tain to daytime rather than residential population - to the number of persons gathered in a given area at a specific time during the day, rather than the number with residence in an area. Estimates are given separately by census tract or comparable geo- graphic area, for both central cities and adjacent urbanized territory. They refer to a current or post- censal date instead of the time at which the most recent Federal census or other survey was taken. These estimates accordingly show little resemblance to conventional population statistics. The need for current daytime population esti- mates is found in many presentday planning prob- lems. In civil defense, for example, such estimates are necessary for developing evacuation procedures, planning the location and size of bomb shelters, and approximating the number of potential (or actual) casualties resulting from atomic attacks. Uptodate figures on daytime population distribution are use- ful also in analyses of thoroughfare, public transit, parking, shopping center, and public utility needs.

Fast forward today, more and more people are becoming mobile, traveling across borders impacting the nuts and bolts of our urban fabric. Unfortunately, our current efforts are being surpassed by the need to capture such transient population. It is becoming imperative to identify and define them, as well as measure their dynamics and interconnectedness. In this work, we intend to research urban population mobility patterns, gauge their transient nature, and extend our knowledge of their visited locations.

  abstract = {Issue Title: SPATIO-TEMPORAL ASPECTS AND DIMENSIONS IN INTEGRATED DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT: CURRENT APPROACHES AND FUTURE CHALLENGES In recent years, uses of high-resolution population distribution databases are increasing steadily for environmental, socioeconomic, public health, and disaster-related research and operations. With the development of daytime population distribution, temporal resolution of such databases has been improved. However, the lack of incorporation of transitional population, namely business and leisure travelers, leaves a significant population unaccounted for within the critical infrastructure networks, such as at transportation hubs. This paper presents two general methodologies for estimating passenger populations in airport and cruise port terminals at a high temporal resolution which can be incorporated into existing population distribution models. The methodologies are geographically scalable and are based on, and demonstrate how, two different transportation hubs with disparate temporal population dynamics can be modeled utilizing publicly available databases including novel data sources of flight activity from the Internet which are updated in near-real time. The airport population estimation model shows great potential for rapid implementation for a large collection of airports on a national scale, and the results suggest reasonable accuracy in the estimated passenger traffic. By incorporating population dynamics at high temporal resolutions into population distribution models, we hope to improve the estimates of populations exposed to or at risk to disasters, thereby improving emergency planning and response, and leading to more informed policy decisions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {A simplified modelling approach to urban commuting patterns is achieved by focusing on daytime populations rather than on commuters, or on the commuting process itself. Whereas past studies were usually economic in nature, and viewed commuting as a process within the continuum of urban space and time, the approach addressing daytime populations transforms the modelling attempt into a demographic deliberation of a binary situation where switching of values between daytime and night-time indicators in each subarea throughout a metropolis is considered. The present study shows that such a focus on diurnal change as a binary concept offers a new paradigm in conceptualizing metropolitan commuting and transportation. Under certain assumptions, rooted in recent observations of metropolitan areas elsewhere, this study conjectures an analytic function for the estimation of daytime populations in small areas throughout the metropolitan region of Brno, Czech Republic. The conjectured relationship is a logistic function that utilizes as its independent variable the average household size in each of the subareas throughout the metropolitan region. Based on the data from the Czech census of 2001, the distributions of average household size and of residential populations throughout the metropolitan region are applied in a case study illustrating the utility of the proposed approach for the estimation of daytime populations throughout the region. The iterative procedure advanced here offers considerable potential for further applications elsewhere.},

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {The accurate estimation of the dynamic changes in population is a key component in effective urban planning and emergency management. We developed a model to estimate hourly dynamic changes in population at the community level based on subway smart card data. The hourly population of each community in six central districts of Beijing was calculated, followed by a study of the spatiotemporal patterns and diurnal dynamic changes of population and an exploration of the main sources and sinks of the observed human mobility. The maximum daytime population of the six central districts of Beijing was approximately 0.7 million larger than the night-time population. The administrative and commercial districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng had high values of population ratio of day to night of 1.35 and 1.22, respectively, whereas Shijingshan, a residential district, had the lowest value of 0.84. Areas with a high population ratio were mainly concentrated in Dongcheng, Xicheng, West Chaoyang, and Southeast Haidian. The daytime population distribution showed a hierarchical spatial pattern of planar centers and second scattered centers as opposed to multiple scattered centers during the night-time. This was because most people moved inward from the areas with a low-high to high-low population ratio of day to night from night-time to daytime, which can be explained by the process of commuting between residential areas and workplaces. Several distinctive phenomena (e.g., the distribution of new industrial parks, the so-called old residential areas, and colleges and universities) in the development of China are reflected by the spatiotemporal pattern of the distribution of population. The general consistency of the population ratios of day to night, population distribution, population variation of typical communities, and population mobility pattern with previous research suggests that the subway smart card data has potential in analyzing dynamic diurnal variations of urban population. This method can be easily duplicated to calculate hourly dynamic changes in population at the community level. These results can be used to estimate the potential hourly number of evacuees under different temporal scenarios of disasters and to support future urban planning in Beijing.},

  abstract = {Today, large-volume mobile phone call datasets are widely applied to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of human urban activity. This paper discusses several fundamental issues in estimating population distributions based on mobile call data. By adopting an individual-based call activity dataset that consists of nearly two million mobile subscribers who made over one hundred million communications over seven consecutive days, we explore the relationships among the Erlang values, the number of calls, and the number of active mobile subscribers. Then, the LandScan population density dataset is introduced to evaluate the process of estimating the population. The empirical findings indicate that: (1) Temporal variation exists in the relation between the Erlang values and the number of calls; (2) The number of calls is linearly proportional to the number of active mobile subscribers; (3) The proportion between the mobile subscribers and the actual total population varies in different areas, thus failing to represent the underlying population. Hence, the call activity reflects "activity intensity" rather than population distribution. The Erlang is a defective indicator of population distribution, whereas the number of calls serves as a better measure. This research provides an explicit clarification with respect to using call activity data for estimating population distribution.},

In this article, we propose a mixture of collective graphical models for estimating people flow from spatiotemporal population data. The spatiotemporal population data we use as input is the number of people in each grid cell area over time, which is aggregated information about many individuals; to preserve privacy, they do not contain trajectories of each individual. Therefore, it is impossible to directly estimate people flow. To overcome this problem, the proposed model assumes that transition populations are hidden variables and estimates the hidden transition populations and transition probabilities simultaneously. The proposed model can handle changes of people flow over time by segmenting time-of-day points into multiple clusters, where different clusters have different flow patterns. We develop an efficient variational Bayesian inference procedure for the collective graphical mixture model. In our experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by using four real-world spatiotemporal population datasets in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Beijing.},

Following a review of attempts to construct time-specific representations of population, we identify the importance of assembling an underlying data model at the high- est resolution in each of the spatial, temporal, and attribute domains. This model can then be interrogated at any required intersection of these domains.We argue that such an approach is necessary to moderate the effects of what we term the modifiable spatiotemporal unit problem in which even detailed spatial data might be inade- quate to support time-sensitive analyses. We present an initial implementation of the framework for a case study of Southampton, United Kingdom, using bespoke software (SurfaceBuilder247). We demonstrate the generation of spatial population distributions for multiple reference times using currently available data sources. The article concludes by setting out key research areas including the enhancement and validation of spatiotem- poral population methods and models.},

The motivation for the research is that present risk models do not take into account the temporal variation in population location during different times of the day. We use spatio-temporal modelling methods to model the population dynamics, and visualization techniques to represent the model outcomes. In addition, we apply the developed model to a damage-analysis application. The case study site is located in the centre of Helsinki. The model uses a basic population and workplace dataset maintained by the Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council. By means of this model, we intend to advance risk assessment, which considers the consequences of accidents. This model has the potential to help decision-makers evaluate their plans in several application areas - such as achieving better preparedness by having more reliable evacuation plans and resource allocation. In addition to the application-related technological research, a more generic framework about decision-making supported by spatio-temporal knowledge and visualization is presented.},

  volume = {31},
  abstract = {Novel digital data sources allow us to attain enhanced knowledge about locations and mobilities of people in space and time. Already a fast-growing body of literature demonstrates the applic- ability and feasibility of mobile phone-based data in social sciences for considering mobile devices as proxies for people. However, the implementation of such data imposes many theore- tical and methodological challenges. One major issue is the uneven spatial resolution of mobile phone data due to the spatial configuration of mobile network base stations and its spatial interpolation. To date, different interpolation techniques are applied to transform mobile phone data into other spatial divi- sions. However, these do not consider the temporality and societal context that shapes the human presence and mobility in space and time. The paper aims, first, to contribute to mobile phone- based research by addressing the need to give more attention to the spatial interpolation of given data, and further by proposing a dasymetric interpolation approach to enhance the spatial accuracy of mobile phone data. Second, it contributes to population mod- elling research by combining spatial, temporal and volumetric dasymetric mapping and integrating it with mobile phone data. In doing so, the paper presents a generic conceptual framework of a multi-temporal function-based dasymetric (MFD) interpolation method for mobile phone data. Empirical results demonstrate how the proposed interpolation method can improve the spatial accu- racy of both night-time and daytime population distributions derived from different mobile phone data sets by taking advan- tage of ancillary data sources. The proposed interpolation method can be applied for both location- and person-based research, and is a fruitful starting point for improving the spatial interpolation methods for mobile phone data. We share the implementation of our method in GitHub as open access Python code.},

To date, however, most research has focused on tourist movements and has been primarily concerned with its impacts on destinations. Less attention has been given to tracing its effects on the localities from which tourists are drawn or to understanding the spatial dynamics that underpin this periodic flux in population. The fact that tourism accounts for a minority of all temporary movements also supports the case for a broader analytical perspective. We aim to redress this neglect by examining seasonal variation in various forms of temporary movement across 77 regions of Australia over the decade 2000-2010, focusing on both origins and destinations. Coupling seasonal factors with cluster analysis and fixed effects models, we show that seasonal mobility across the Australian settlement system is highly structured with spatio-temporal variations reflecting the interplay of climatic variability with institutional constraints and the functional characteristics of regions.

A GIS-based stochastic geocoding algorithm is proposed to generate daytime population distribution patterns using travel survey data. Metropolitan Melbourne in Australia is used as a test case with data collected from the Victorian Activity and Travel Survey between 1994 and 1999. The advantage of employing daytime population distributions for vehicle route planning is then illustrated taking dangerous goods delivery and mobile billboard advertising as examples. Analysis suggests that the proposed algorithm generates population distribution patterns with finer spatial and temporal details than that obtained using other estimation methods. The algorithm also eliminates the problem of over- or under-estimation of population associated with previous attempts using travel survey data and therefore provides more accurate results.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that 50\% of the global population lives in urban areas occupying just 0.4\% of the Earth's surface. Understanding urban activity constitutes monitoring population density and its changes over time, in urban environments. Currently, there are limited mechanisms to non-intrusively monitor population density in real-time. The pervasive use of cellular phones in urban areas is one such mechanism that provides a unique opportunity to study population density by monitoring the mobility patterns in near real-time. Cellular carriers such as AT\&T harvest such data through their cell towers; however, this data is proprietary and the carriers restrict access, due to privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a system that passively senses the population density and infers mobility patterns in an urban area by monitoring power spectral density in cellular frequency bands using periodic beacons from each cellphone without knowing who and where they are located. A wireless sensor network platform is being developed to perform spectral monitoring along with environmental measurements. Algorithms are developed to generate real-time fine-resolution population estimates.},

The results showed that approximately 5\% of the population of Estonia change their place of residence seasonally. The number of residents rises during the summer months in coastal areas, the surroundings of cities, and in specific `dacha' areas. Most of these seasonal migrants originated from cities and towns. The timing and geography of the seasonal migration patterns studied showed the different directions and causes of seasonal moves. The methodology developed for the monitoring of short-term migration is suitable for the monitoring of movements over more extensive territory. In order to determine the causes and composition of these migrations, however, one must use additional survey studies or observations.},

  title = {Seasonal Residence and Counterurbanization: The Role of Second Homes in Population Redistribution in {{Finland}}},
  volume = {82},
  abstract = {Since the late twentieth century, many developed countries have experienced population deconcentration, labelled as counterurbanization. There has been an academic discussion on the meaning, validity and universality of this concept, drivers of counterurbanization and its impacts on rural areas. To date, research on counterurbanization mostly apply static and discrete definitions of residence, migration and population, which is an increasingly simplistic view in the contemporary reality of a growing multitude of forms of mobility, often related to dual residence. Particularly large-scale quantitative studies on counterurbanization are confined by existing statistical practices. This paper attempts to overcome this obstacle and describe the transformation of the settlement system in Finland acknowledging the role of second home mobility. To achieve this goal, it introduces two alternative measures of population, seasonal and average population, and analyses their spatial dynamics between the years 1990 and 2010 based on georeferenced grid statistical data. The study finds that although registered population has been concentrating during the period in analysis, seasonal population has been increasingly dispersed due to the growing number of second homes. It shows that the counterurbanization process, though not noticed by conventional statistics, does occur in Finland, manifested by seasonal rather than permanent moves. The article concludes that various forms of mobility should be taken into account when analysing the urban\textendash{}rural population dynamics and transformations of settlement systems as well as in rural development planning.},

  abstract = {High-resolution population distribution data are critical for successfully addressing important issues ranging from socio-environmental research to public health to homeland security, since scientific analyses, operational activities, and policy decisions are significantly influenced by the number of impacted people. Dasymetric modeling has been a well-recognized approach for spatial decomposition of census data to increase the spatial resolution of population distribution. However, enhancing the temporal resolution of population distribution poses a greater challenge. In this paper, we discuss the development of LandScan USA, a multi-dimensional dasymetric modeling approach, which has allowed the creation of a very high-resolution population distribution data both over space and time. At a spatial resolution of 3 arc seconds ({$\sim$}90 m), the initial LandScan USA database contains both a nighttime residential as well as a baseline daytime population distribution that incorporates movement of workers and students. Challenging research issues of disparate and misaligned spatial data and modeling to develop a database at a national scale, as well as model verification and validation approaches are illustrated and discussed. Initial analyses indicate a high degree of locational accuracy for LandScan USA distribution model and data. High-resolution population data such as LandScan USA, which describes both distribution and dynamics of human population, clearly has the potential to profoundly impact multiple domain applications of national and global priority. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

While several studies have focused on understanding flows of people throughout a city, these data can also be used to create a more spatially and temporally granular picture of local population, and to forecast localized population given some exogenous environmental or physical conditions. Effectively modeling population dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions would have significant implications for city operations and policy, strategic long-term planning processes, emergency response and management, and public health. This paper develops a real-time census of the city using Wi-Fi data to explore urban phenology as a function of localized population dynamics.

Our building-level test case demonstrates similar accuracy, estimating worker population to within 1\% of the reported building occupancy.},

  abstract = {Considerations of metropolitan commuting have often related to urban space as a continuum, and to commuting itself as a process. This approach has led to escalating complexity in the measurement, modeling and analysis of commuting, often with no commensurate results. The present study extends an alternative approach that considers commuter space of a metropolis as a discrete set of small areas. Each small area throughout the metropolis is a nighttime location of some households and, as a possible discrete destination choice of individuals within households, each subarea is also a daytime location of some persons. Each subarea, therefore, may be thought of as attaining two values, corresponding to its daytime (e.g., noontime) and nighttime (e.g., midnight) populations. The diurnal demographic shift of subareas, as a set of binary events, or toggles, between daytime and nighttime populations, is associated with commuter access throughout the metropolis. Diurnal shift offers structural simplicity aimed at estimating small-area daytime populations across a metropolitan region that might suitably precede and complement conventional continuum considerations of commuting. Using data for the Tokyo Metropolitan Region, we identify average household size as the nighttime indicator of small-areas, and daytime population density as their daytime indicator. The potential for the estimation of daytime populations across metropolitan regions where daytime population data are unavailable, is underscored by the clear tendency towards inverse relation of these two indicators of diurnal shift.},

Then, daytime population density surface are generated from the randomly dispersed employee points. Because there is no reference data, it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the high-resolution daytime population distribution precisely. However, it is confirmed that the distribution of the daytime population density compared to the resident population distribution is higher in urban areas including universities and commercial areas, public buildings etc. It is expected that such an attempt will be a reasonable alternative for estimating the affected population and evaluating the social vulnerability in the region in case of unexpected disaster.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Most migration statistics in the United States focus on changes in place of usual residence, thereby missing temporary moves such as business trips, vacations, and seasonal migration. In this article, we analyze the temporary in- and out-migration of elderly adults in Florida. Our primary objectives are to develop a methodology for estimating the number of temporary migrants and to analyze their demographic characteristics.Methods. Using survey data, we estimated the number, timing, and duration of temporary moves and the origins, destinations, and characteristics of elderly temporary migrants. We compared the characteristics of temporary in-migrants, out-migrants, and non-migrants, and we used logistic regression analysis in order to evaluate differences in those characteristics.Results. We estimate that Florida had more than 800,000 elderly temporary in-migrants and more than 300,000 elderly temporary out-migrants at peak times in 2005. Income, education, employment, and health status were among the major determinants of temporary migration.Discussion. The temporary migration of elderly adults has a major impact on the resident populations of both sending and receiving communities. This article presents a methodology for estimating temporary migration and provides insights into migratory patterns that cannot be achieved by focusing solely on changes in place of usual residence.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is now recognized as the world's single largest environmental and human health threat. Indeed, a large number of environmental epidemiological studies have quantified the health impacts of population exposure to pollution. In previous studies, exposure estimates at the population level have not considered spatially- and temporally varying populations present in study regions. Therefore, in the first study of it is kind, we use measured population activity patterns representing several million people to evaluate population-weighted exposure to air pollution on a city-wide scale. Mobile and wireless devices yield information about where and when people are present, thus collective activity patterns were determined using counts of connections to the cellular network. Population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 in New York City (NYC), herein termed ``Active Population Exposure'' was evaluated using population activity patterns and spatiotemporal PM2.5 concentration levels, and compared to ``Home Population Exposure'', which assumed a static population distribution as per Census data. Areas of relatively higher population-weighted exposures were concentrated in different districts within NYC in both scenarios. These were more centralized for the ``Active Population Exposure'' scenario. Population-weighted exposure computed in each district of NYC for the ``Active'' scenario were found to be statistically significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) different to the ``Home'' scenario for most districts. In investigating the temporal variability of the ``Active'' population-weighted exposures determined in districts, these were found to be significantly different (p {$<$} 0.05) during the daytime and the nighttime. Evaluating population exposure to air pollution using spatiotemporal population mobility patterns warrants consideration in future environmental epidemiological studies linking air quality and human health.},

Current approaches to population estimation are usually limited either by the use of arbitrary administrative boundaries or insufficient resolution in the temporal dimension. The innovative approach proposed here combines the use of a spatio-temporal gridded population model with flood inundation data to estimate time-specific variations in population exposed to natural hazards. The approach is exemplified through an application centred on Southampton (UK) using Environment Agency flood map inundation data. Results demonstrate that large fluctuations occur over time in the population distribution within flood risk zones. Variations in the spatio-temporal distribution of population subgroups are explored. Analysis using GIS indicates a diurnal shift in exposure between fluvial and tidal flooding, particularly attributable to the movement of the working age population. This illustrates the improvements achievable to flood risk management as well as potential application to other natural hazard scenarios both within the UK and globally.},

  abstract = {Purpose
Crime analysts need accurate population-at-risk measures to quantify crime rates. This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for `theft from the person' crimes.
Method
1.Collect `ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media.2.Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor.3.Use the Gi* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators.4.Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates.
Results and Discussion
The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors \textendash{} i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban population is crucial for addressing a wide range of urban planning and management issues. Aggregated geospatial big data have been widely used to quantitatively estimate population distribution at fine spatial scales over a given time period. However, it is still a challenge to estimate population density at a fine temporal resolution over a large geographical space, mainly due to the temporal asynchrony of population movement and the challenges to acquiring a complete individual movement record. In this article, we propose a method to estimate hourly population density by examining the time-series individual trajectories, which were reconstructed from call detail records using BP neural networks. We first used BP neural networks to predict the positions of mobile phone users at an hourly interval and then estimated the hourly population density using log-linear regression at the cell tower level. The estimated population density is linearly correlated with population census data at the sub-district level. Trajectory clustering results show five distinct diurnal dynamic patterns of population movement in the study area, revealing spatially explicit characteristics of the diurnal commuting flows, though the driving forces of the flows need further investigation.},

The PCA-ADE-BPNN model is a new combination of a dimensional reduction algorithm, an optimization algorithm, and a neural network. The validity of this model is demonstrated by conducting case studies of Beijing City and Hainan Province, China. The results indicate the proposed PCA-ADE-BPNN always outperforms other models in terms of forecasting accuracies. Therefore, the proposed PCA-ADE-BPNN is a potential candidate for the effective forecasting of tourist volume.},

  abstract = {This report addresses the question of whether it is technically, financially and legally feasible to estimate geographic mobility and migration flows in the European Union. Our assessment indicates that the feasibility is dependent on a number of factors: 1. It depends on the data that one can have access to. Some data sources can be accessed by anyone with the appropriate technical skills (e.g., samples of Twitter tweets); some can be purchased (e.g., historical tweets); some are not for sale and require partnerships with companies (e.g., Yahoo!, Facebook, LinkedIn, and mobile phone providers); some are not shared by companies (Google does not share data, except for some aggregate indexes, like the ones in Google Trends). 2. It depends on the outcome desired. Estimating trends or changes in trends in migration flows is feasible and can be done in a timely manner. Getting accurate and precise estimates for special populations, like refugees, may or may not be feasible depending on the context: it would require further research. Likewise, obtaining estimates of short-term migration by education, gender or employment status is feasible. Obtaining unbiased estimates of short-term mobility from a single, non-representative source would be more difficult. It may be feasible in some circumstances (e.g., when the data set is rich enough for the use of post-stratification techniques), but not in others. 3. It depends on legal obstacles. Companies may have terms and conditions or non- disclosure agreements for data sharing that may or may not include inconsistencies with the rules governing universities and funding agencies. We have not identified major issues in this area, but each individual collaboration across units would require some careful examination of the terms and conditions in order to resolve any potential lack of consistency.},

The geographical units reflect administrative boundaries at different levels of detail, from Devolved Administration to Output Areas (OA), wards or intermediate geographies. While the presentation of data on the level of these geographical units is useful for statistical purposes, accounting for spatial variability for instance of environmental determinants of public health requires a more spatially homogeneous population distribution.

In this paper, we adapt a methodology originally proposed by Roddis and Richardson (1998) for tracking populations across the day using large household travel survey databases. Using five-year pooled data from the Sydney HTS, we effectively take population `snapshots' of the city every 5 minutes, and locate the population using the origin-destination, time and weighting information from the survey sample. We then apply the approach to two different case studies, namely 1) emergency evacuation in the Sydney CBD, and 2) exposure to air and aircraft noise pollution. Through the case studies we demonstrate the various strengths of the approach as well as the caveats, which primarily relate to sample size issues for small-area applications, and the frequent need to examine weekday and weekend populations separately. In the case of exposure to various forms of pollution, we need to carefully consider the production and dispersion behaviour of the pollutant in question, if we wish to obtain a precise `dynamic' population exposure.},

  abstract = {Places of household residence and places of commuter destination are considered in a contiguous system of subareas constituting a region. An intrahousehold distribution of household members, by subarea of their commuting destination, is considered for each subarea of residence. A household composition matrix is constructed in reference to the average number of commuters to subareas of destination, per household at a subarea of residence, across all subareas. The matrix is a linear transformation from the spatial distribution of households onto the spatial distribution of daytime population, over all subareas of the region. Diurnal population change throughout the region is rendered by this transformation. A linear optimization model extending this transformation formalizes general conditions that relate the diurnal population system to household choice of residence and work. Further, the division of the region into subareas is assumed to be such that the average household in each subarea contains at least one person who remains in the subarea during day and night. Under these conditions, the diurnal system is shown to be analogous to the Leontief input-output model. An example of eleven counties of North Wales, along with an exogenous area of northwestern England, drawn from the 1991 census of the United Kingdom, illustrates the formal relationships.},

This approach allows the average number of persons per household who commute to be hierarchically ordered in a square matrix which shows attributes associated with a well-known class of matrices. Based on these attributes it is shown that any given spatial distribution of households implies a bounded range of vectors representing the spatial distribution of commuters. Two related distributions correspond to night-time and daytime populations in the metropolitan subareas. Whereas much of contemporary urban modelling is rooted in economic considerations, this alternative approach replaces explicit economic reasoning with some speculative considerations.

Associated with the average household in each subarea is the distribution of its members by their daytime destinations. Travel allocation of individuals by their principal subarea of daytime destination can be thus constructed for the average household in each subarea throughout a city. Intrahousehold allocation of daytime destinations can thus be represented in a convenient tabular form, the household composition matrix. Further interpretation shows the household composition matrix to be a special case of an origin-destination (O-D) matrix representing commuter volumes between subareas of nighttime and daytime location. Formal features of the household composition matrix, furthermore, render it equivalent to the Leontief input-output matrix. The relationship between intrahousehold travel allocation and household composition, as an O-D matrix, emerges to be of particular importance within the context of Leontief's input-output concept. Application to the Seoul Metropolitan Area indicates a discernable pattern in intrahousehold travel allocation when ordering of the household composition matrix is based on ratios between daytime and nighttime populations across the city's subareas.},

However, fine-grained population modeling has been challenging because the urban population is highly dynamic and its mobility pattern is complex in space and time. In this study, we propose a method to predict the population at a large spatiotemporal scale in a city. This method models the temporal dependency of population by estimating the future inflow population with the current inflow pattern and models the spatial correlation of population using an artificial neural network. With a large dataset of mobile phone locations, the model's prediction error is low and only increases gradually as the temporal prediction granularity increases, and this model is adaptive to sudden changes in population caused by special events.},

Previous solutions look at data generated by human activities, such as night time lights and phone calls, for population estimation. However, these mechanisms cannot achieve both real-time and fine-grained population estimation because the data sampling rate is low and spatial granularity chosen is improper. We address these two problems by leveraging a key insight --- people frequently use data plan on cellphones and leave mobility signatures on cellular networks. Therefore, we are able to exploit these cellular signatures for real-time population estimation. Extracting population information from cellular data records is not easy because the number of users recorded by a cellular tower is not equal to the population covered by the tower, and mobile users' behavior is spatially and temporally different, where static estimating model does not work. We exploit context-aware city segmentation and dynamic population estimation model to address these challenges. We show that the population estimation error is reduced by 22.5\% on a cellular dataset that includes 1 million users.},

Consequently the prediction of tourist numbers is important for tourist attractions management and planning.

This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting tourist flows based on the Baidu Index. The Index provides search history containing different keywords on a daily basis dating back to 2006. The approach uses co-integration theory and Granger causality analysis to find the relationship between the internet search data and the actual tourist flow. The paper compares analysis results obtained by two kinds of predictive models, with or without considering Baidu Index. The study shows that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship and Granger causal relation between the observed number of tourists and a set of related keywords in the Baidu Index. It indicated a positive correlation between the increasing Baidu keyword search index and the increasing observed tourist flow.},

Apart from generating clear statistics such as visitor counts, the share of returning visitors, and visitor flow maps, the analyses also reveal the complex nature of this event by hinting at the existence of several mutually different visitor profiles.

However, there is a clear need to consider the location of people across the day in planning for the provision of facilities that will be used during the day. Data from the Victorian Activity and Travel Survey were used to develop methods by which daytime population behavior can be examined. Specifically, two measures were developed. A population profile provides an estimate of population within any region at any time of the day. A visitation curve supplements the population profile by monitoring the number of people using a region across the day. Further disaggregation of the population to reveal behavioral and demographic characteristics constitutes an important component of the methodology.},

  abstract = {Background: Temporary population mobility, moves of more than one night's duration that do not entail a change in usual residence, are an important feature of the Australian population surface. The ABS Census of Population and Housing (Census) provides a snapshot of temporary movements one night every five years. Aims: This paper examines the intensity, age and spatial patterns of temporary movements captured at the 2016 Census, and creates a classification of regions based on the age profile of movers on Census nights. Data and methods: 2016 Census data were extracted using ABS TableBuilder Pro. Summary metrics were calculated to measure the intensity and age profile of movements. Origin\textendash{}destination flows were derived from a cross-classification of data on Place of Usual Residence and Place of Enumeration. A classification of regions (SA4s) was constructed from the age profile of movers at origins and at destinations. Results: 1,142,005 individuals (about 5 per cent of the Australian population) were enumerated away from home on Census night 2016. Mobility peaked in younger (20\textendash{}30) and older (65\textendash{}70) age groups. Most movements were between capital city regions; however, resource regions and coastal areas were also implicated. The mobility surface was segmented by age: younger people dominated visits to cities and older movers comprise the majority of visitors to coastal areas, while remote areas had a significant proportion of visitors in the peak working ages. Conclusions: Temporary population mobility is selective by age and sex and geographically segmented by these characteristics. Improved understanding of the attribute of visitors to regions can assist to formulate and validate estimates of temporary populations from emerging data sets.},

However, few studies have measured the stability of aggregate human convergence or divergence patterns. We propose a spatiotemporal model for assessing the stability of human convergence and divergence patterns. A mobile phone location data set obtained from Shenzhen, China, was used to assess the stability of daily human convergence and divergence patterns at three different spatial scales, i.e. points (cell phone towers), lines (bus lines) and areas (traffic analysis zones [TAZs]). Our analysis results demonstrated that the proposed model can identify points and bus lines with time-dependent variations in stability, which is useful for delineating TAZs for transportation planning, or adjusting bus timetables and routes to meet the needs of bus riders. Comparisons of the results obtained from the proposed model and the widely used entropy measure indicated that the proposed model is suitable for assessing the differences in stability for various types of spatial analysis units, e.g. cell phone towers. Therefore, the proposed model is a useful alternative approach of measuring spatiotemporal stability of aggregate human convergence and divergence patterns, which can be derived from the space\textendash{}time trajectories of moving objects.},

  abstract = {Characterizing human mobility patterns is essential for understanding human behaviors and the interactions with socioeconomic and natural environment, and plays a critical role in public health, urban planning, transportation engineering and related fields. With the widespread of location-aware mobile devices and continuing advancement of Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social media (LBSM) have been gaining widespread popularity in the past few years. With an access to locations of hundreds of million users, profiles and the contents of the social media posts, the LBSM data provided a novel modality of data source for human mobility study. By exploiting the explicit location footprints and mining the latent demographic information implied in the LBSM data, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of human mobility with a particular focus on the impact of demography. To serve this purpose, we first collect geo-tagged Twitter feeds posted in the conterminous United States area, and organize the collection of feeds using the concept of space-time trajectory corresponding to each Twitter user. Commonly human mobility measures, including detected home and activity centers, are derived for each user trajectory. We then select a subset of Twitter users that have detected home locations in the city of Chicago as a case study, and apply name analysis to the names provided in user profiles to learn the implicit demographic information of Twitter users, including race/ethnicity, gender and age. Finally we explore the spatiotemporal distribution and mobility characteristics of Chicago Twitter users, and investigate the demographic impact by comparing the differences across three demographic dimensions (race/ethnicity, gender and age). We found that, although the human mobility measures of different demographic groups generally follow the generic laws (e.g., power law distribution), the demographic information, particular the race/ethnicity group, significantly affects the urban human mobility patterns.},

Therefore, understanding and predicting human behavior and mobility during a disaster will play a vital role in planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, such research is very difficult to perform owing to the uniqueness of various disasters and the unavailability of reliable and large-scale human mobility data. In this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records of 1.6 million users1 over 3 years, data on earthquakes that have occurred in Japan over 4 years, news report data, and transportation network data) to study human mobility following natural disasters. An empirical analysis is conducted to explore the basic laws governing human mobility following disasters, and an effective human mobility model is developed to predict and simulate population movements. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model, and they suggest that human mobility following disasters can be significantly more predictable and be more easily simulated than previously thought.},

Data from the 1991 Australian Census are then used to analyse the incidence of temporary movements, the characteristics of temporary movers, and their spatial distribution. It is shown that temporary mobility is selective of certain groups and that there are substantial concentrations of temporary movers in both coastal and inland locations. By combining analysis of their origins with the attributes of their destinations, a preliminary typology of temporary population movement is proposed. The concluding section considers the implications of this form of mobility and identifies some avenues for further research.},

Direct measurement of temporary populations has proven prohibitively expensive, while indirect estimates based on symptomatic data have met with limited success. We propose an alternative approach based on a stochastic simulation model that couples seasonality of mobility with duration of stay and is made operational using Monte Carlo methods. Drawing on data from the Australian National Visitor Survey, we identify families of distributions fitting seasonality and duration. Random samples are then drawn from these, and combined to produce estimates of `Visitor Nights' for thirteen selected municipalities. Results are promising with the synthetic estimates correlating closely with observed data from the Australian Small Area Accommodation Survey.},

Recognition of the importance of temporary populations has grown considerably in recent decades, both in Australia and overseas, however a standard methodology for their estimation has yet to be advanced. This paper reviews available data and methods for the estimation of temporary populations in Australia. Three broad approaches are identified: direct approaches which draw on censuses and surveys to estimate temporary stocks and flows; indirect methods, which rely on symptomatic indicators of population flux; and data derived from information and communication technologies. A model framework capable of integrating multiple data sets, VisPOP, is then described. The utility of different data sets for the estimation of temporary populations in Australia are assessed using Noosa, Queensland as a case study. While no single data source is likely to prove a panacea for the estimation of temporary populations in all locations and contexts, results suggest that it is possible to integrate multiple data sets to produce reliable estimates of non-resident populations.},

  title = {How to Tally Temporary Populations},
  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Most population statistics count people at their usual place of residence; yet anyone who has spent a spring vacation in Daytona Beach knows that many places are occasionally flooded with tourists and other temporary residents. In addition, many cities receive huge inflows of daytime visitors who come to work, shop, or attend a ball game. People tend to ignore what they cannot measure, but business need reliable information on temporary populations so they can reach these large and lucrative markets. "Visitor days" are the total number of days all temporary residents spend in an area. Many social and economic indicators (such as crime rates, water consumption, and park use) would be more meaningful if temporary residents were included with permanent residents when calculating rates. There are 2 ways to estimate the temporary population: 1) the direct approach using census statistics and sample surveys and 2) the indirect approach using other indicators of population change. In 1980, the Census Bureau counted people who were temporarily away from their usual place of residence, but only people who were staying in housing units occupied entirely by nonpermanent residents. Almost half of the 547,100 nonpermanent residents were in Florida. The 1980 census also collected data on where people work. Among state governments, only Hawaii makes comprehensive estimates and projections of its temporary residents. The University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research takes a monthly telephone survey that asks temporary residents for their lenght of stay, place of usual residence, and demographic characteristics. Arizona State University's Center of Business Research recently began estimating the temporary population of the Phoenix area. Other sources of population data include 1) contacting realtors, planners, and managers of hotels, motels, trailer parks, and campgrounds; and 2) counting the number of electric or water customers, traffic counts, sales tax collections, occupied hotel and motel rooms, and other indicators of total population change.},

This phenomenon brings the variation of population distribution between daytime and night-time, which can be indicated by the ratio of daytime population to night-time or residential population calculated on the basis of place-of-work and place-of-schooling data.
Observing the maps presenting the ratios of daytime to night-time population by shi, ku, machi, and mura (minor administrative divisions) based on the 1970 population census results, it is recognized in general that the city with the ratio of 100.0 and over or larger population in daytime than in night-time is surrounded by the minor administrative divisions with the ratio of less than 100.0 or smaller population in daytime than in night-time, and it may be suggested that the former is greater in the centrality than the latters.
The changes in the ratio of daytime to nighttime population over 1960 to 1970 for all of the cities present that in general the ratio increased in the city with that of 100.0 and over for 1960 while it declined in the city with that of less than 100.0 for 1960 over the period from 1960 to 1970. Accordingly, it may be implied that the centrality in the former city has become greater while that in the latter city has been smaller in 1970 than in 1960.
In Tokyo and Osaka cities the population density in daytime by each ward as of 1970 presented the highest at the city center; and the further the distance from the center, the lower the density. On the other hand the density in night-time indicated the highest at the inner zone located outside the city center and it showed rather low at the city center.
Examining the population densities in both daytime and night-time by wards of Tokyo for 1930, 1940, 1947, 1960, 1965, and 1970, it was found that the pattern of change of population densities in both daytime and night-time over the period from 1930 to 1970 was different by location of ward. Based on the difference of the pattern twenty three wards were classified into the following five types: the city center type, the inner zone type, the sub-center type, the outer zone type, and the suburban area type. Also, it was found that the area showing the highest population density in daytime was Taito-ku, the traditional commercial district, in 1930 and 1940, but it shifted in 1947 to Chuo-ku, the commercial and business district, and then it moved to Chiyoda-ku, the modern central business district, in 1960. Similar process was recognized in Osaka city.},

  abstract = {Recently, mobile phone data was applied in travel demand modeling as a new source of dynamic population movement. This study is also aimed to estimate "occupancy population" during a given period of time within a given spatial region using mobile phone data. An occupancy population was defined as the number of people residing or moving within a given time and space. In case of Seoul Metropolitan area, we divided the area into a number of administrative districts as zones for analysis and estimated the occupancy population of each zone by mobile phone data collected by SK telecom Co., a wireless telecommunication provider in Korea. For the expansion of mobile phone data, a new concept of "communication probability" was introduced and applied in the estimation of occupancy population of each zone by the hour. We compared the estimated number with the daytime population and the daytime population index referred by the Statistics Korea. The results showed that a positive correlation existed between the estimated number and the statistical number by nationwide survey. It was concluded that mobile phone data could be more cost-effective sources than a conventional survey method to estimate the pattern of population movement by the hour or by the day.},

  volume = {68},
  abstract = {Urban population at daytime and nighttime and their spatial distribution are basis for planning urban infrastructure, public services and disaster relief, and it is also a leading edge for urban geography study. Because current statistical data in China cannot distinguish urban population at daytime from that at nighttime, existing research in this field is limited. Aiming to estimate urban population at daytime and nighttime and to analyze their spatial characteristics, this paper establishes a relationship model among urban population, time (daytime or nighttime) and types of land-use, and a population spatial distribution model based on different area weights, and also conducts an empirical study on the Haidian District in Beijing. The results are shown as follows. (1) There are many differences between daytime and nighttime population in spatial structure. Population is more concentrated during daytime. (2) There are many spatial coupling relationships between daytime and nighttime population, such as sandwich mode, inlay mode, convergence mode, and monomer mode. (3) There is a great difference in the use of road networks between daytime and nighttime. This phenomenon is related to the spatial distribution between daytime and nighttime. It seems that daytime population has a notable influence on road expansion. The spatial distribution of daytime and nighttime population also reflects some phenomena in the development of China, such as the distribution of old residential areas, the construction of new industrial districts, the differences between urban and rural areas, which can provide some reference for the studies in this field and other regional research.},

In order to evaluate earthquake impact, this article focuses on the spatiotemporal distribution of population and five scenario earthquakes that form the basis for loss estimation in the city of Sylhet, Bangladesh. Four temporal contexts (weekday, weekly holiday, the 30 days of Ramadan, and strike days) expand the more typical daytime and nighttime settings in which to examine hazard risk. The population distribution for every 2 hour interval in a day is developed for each type of day. A relationship between the occupancy classes and average space (persons per 100 m2) is used to distribute people in each building regardless of building locations. A total daytime and nighttime population is obtained for each building and the estimated nighttime population is used to model the population for four temporal scenarios in a year based on different factors and weights. The resulting data are employed to estimate population loss for each of the temporal and earthquake scenarios. This study used building-specific human vulnerability curves developed by the Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) to obtain possible loss of life estimates. The results reveal that there is a high positive correlation between the spatiotemporal distribution of population and the potential number of casualties.},

  abstract = {Second-home tourism is a very popular form of tourism in many countries, particularly in the Nordic countries. More than half of the Swedish population have access to second homes. Previous studies have revealed that there is great variation between different second homes. Examples range from rustic Australian shacks, lonely cabins in the Norwegian mountains, spacious Swedish archipelago villas and palatial Russian dachas. Still, second homes are often seen and analysed as a unitary category \textendash{} a perspective that obscures the considerable heterogeneity within the category as well as spatial differences in the impact of second-home tourism. Using a second-home typology from previous research and data on about 660,000 second homes, we analyse the heterogeneity of second homes by mapping the composition of the Swedish second-home stock. Results show the uneven geography of second-home tourism, revealing significant and sometimes steep differences between peripheral areas and urban hinterlands, tourism hot-spots, and areas in decline. Based on these results, we assert that there is good cause to move away from using second homes as a unitary category. Instead, we argue for viewing second homes as an umbrella concept with dwelling use in focus. This enables a greater sensibility to place and more accurate analyses of the uneven impacts of second-home tourism. The results also give greater insights into the impact of the `invisible population' of second-home owners from a public planning perspective.},

  abstract = {Knowing the spatiotemporal distribution of population at the local level is fundamental for many applications, including risk management, health and environmental studies, territorial planning and management, and GeoMarketing. Census figures register where people reside and usually sleep, and are frequently the only data source available for such analyses. Currently, the analysis of service areas and population served is mostly made considering only census data as source of population distribution, while some businesses clearly serve mostly a daytime population. However, population density is not constant within census enumeration areas. Also, due to human activities, population counts and their distribution vary widely from nighttime to daytime, especially in metropolitan areas, and this variation is not captured by census data. Raster dasymetric mapping within geographic modeling allows transforming raw population counts to population density limited to specific areas where the variable is present, in more detailed temporal periods, by using ancillary data sets and zonal interpolation. In GeoMarketing, this information is especially useful for retail sales, banking, insurance, lodging, real estate, and franchising. These refined distributions can be used to improve such analyses as site selection, service area and population served, assessment of potential markets, routing activities, location-allocation, and gravity models. This study uses such a dasymetric mapping approach for detailed modeling and mapping of the spatiotemporal distribution of population in the daily cycle. These data sets are used to assess the location and the varying population contained in the service areas of existing and prospective commercial facilities in the daily cycle, for different types of businesses. Applications in GeoMarketing using spatial analysis are illustrated for three different scenarios involving private sector services where maximizing coverage of target population is paramount for success. The case studies show that when the spatiotemporal distribution of population is considered, the obtained set of solutions differs from the one produced by using census-based data alone. The results demonstrate that enhancing population distribution data through geographical modeling can greatly benefit spatial analysis in GeoMarketing, resulting in the production of better information that ultimately allows improved decision-making.},

Assessment of earthquake risk in urban areas would benefit from considering the variation of population distribution at more detailed spatial and temporal scales, and from a more explicit integration of this improved demographic data with existing seismic hazard maps. In the present work, "intelligent" dasymetric mapping is used to model population dynamics at high spatial resolution in order to benefit the analysis of spatio-temporal exposure to earthquake hazard in a metropolitan area. These night- and daytime-specific population densities are then classified and combined with seismic intensity levels to derive new spatially-explicit four-class-composite maps of human exposure. The presented approach enables a more thorough assessment of population exposure to earthquake hazard. Results show that there are significantly more people potentially at risk in the daytime period, demonstrating the shifting nature of population exposure in the daily cycle and the need to move beyond conventional residence-based demographic data sources to improve risk analyses. The proposed fine-scale maps of human exposure to seismic intensity are mainly aimed at benefiting visualization and communication of earthquake risk, but can be valuable in all phases of the disaster management process where knowledge of population densities is relevant for decision-making.},

In Europe, directives require that urban environmental noise be measured and mapped for the main periods of the daily cycle. Subsequent analyses of human exposure to noise in those periods is usually conducted using resident (i.e., nighttime) population from the census and assuming constant densities within the enumeration units. However, population distribution and densities vary considerably from night to day in metropolitan areas, and disregard for that process results in gross misestimation of exposure to ambient noise in the daytime period.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This study considers the spatio-temporal variation of population distribution in assessing exposure to ambient noise in a major urban area, the city of Lisbon, Portugal. Detailed and compatible day- and nighttime population distribution maps were used, developed by means of "intelligent dasymetric mapping". After categorizing noise levels in existing maps in each period, classified according to current legislation, human exposure to ambient noise was assessed with temporally matching population surfaces. Population exposure to noise in 2000 and 2009 was compared and further analyzed in regards to main source of noise, i.e. road traffic vs. aircraft..{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Results show that human exposure to noise shifts substantially in time and space, with a significant increase in exposed population from the nighttime to daytime period, especially in the higher noise levels.

  abstract = {Tsunamis are among the most destructive and lethal of coastal hazards. These are time-specific events, and despite directly affecting a narrow strip of coastline, a single occurrence can have devastating effects and cause massive loss of life, especially in urbanized coastal areas. In this work, in order to consider the time dependence of population exposure to tsunami threat, the variation of spatio-temporal population distribution in the daily cycle is mapped and analyzed in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. High-resolution daytime and nighttime population distribution maps are developed using `intelligent dasymetric mapping,' that is, applying areal interpolation to combine best-available census data and statistics with land use and land cover data. Workplace information and mobility statistics are considered for mapping daytime distribution. In combination with a tsunami hazard map, information on infrastructure, land use and terrain slope, the modeled population distribution is used to assess people's evacuation speed, applying a geospatial evacuation modeling approach to the city of Lisbon. The detailed dynamic population exposure assessment allows producing both daytime and nighttime evacuation time maps, which provide valuable input for evacuation planning and management. Results show that a significant amount of population is at risk, and its numbers increase dramatically from nighttime to daytime, especially in the zones of high tsunami flooding susceptibility. Also, full evacuation can be problematic in the daytime period, even if initiated immediately after a major tsunami-triggering earthquake. The presented approach greatly improves tsunami risk assessment and can benefit all phases of the disaster management process.},

  abstract = {Natural or man-made disasters (e.g., earthquakes, fires, toxic releases,
terrorism, etc.) usually occur without warning and can affect large numbers of
people. Census figures register where people reside and usually sleep, but
when disaster strikes knowing where people are more likely to be at the time
of the event can be invaluable information for adequate emergency response
and evacuation planning. These data can also be useful for risk and
consequence assessment or a variety of studies involving population, such as
transportation planning, land planning, GeoMarketing, and health and
environmental studies. Having this information in a GIS-usable raster format
significantly increases its value and facilitates integration with other spatial
datasets for analysis or modeling. The validity of the concept of ambient
population for the desired purposes has been demonstrated by the recent
development of global population distribution databases. However, the
highest spatial resolution data available (30 arc seconds) for Portugal, though
appropriate for use in major hazard events (e.g. volcanic eruptions, major
earthquakes) which typically affect large areas, is too coarse for many
practical uses in the country, especially at the local scale. Therefore, higherresolution
databases of daytime and nighttime population distributions are
currently being developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory and Oak Ridge
National Laboratory for the US, based on two different approaches.
This study concerns the development of fine-scale raster datasets of
daytime and nighttime population distributions for two municipalities of
Metropolitan Lisbon in Portugal, Cascais and Oeiras. Their combined
population was 332,811 in 2001. The most recent census enumeration figures and mobility statistics (2001) are combined with physiographic data, using
areal interpolation in a dasymetric mapping approach. To model nighttime
population, land use and land cover classes from different datasets are
selected and combined with street centerlines to derive residential streets to
which population is allocated in each census block group. The addresses of
private businesses and public services (including health care facilities and
schools) and respective workforce in each municipality are georeferenced to
model the daytime worker population of 139,074, which is combined with a
derived map of daytime residential population to estimate overall daytime
population. Because reliable high-resolution results require accurate input
data, a significant effort was devoted to verifying and improving input
datasets, especially land use and land cover, street centerlines and business
addresses.
Main results represent maximum daytime population and maximum
nighttime residential population in 2001 for each 25-meter grid cell in the
study area. Since the same spatial reference base was used to map
population density, day and night distributions are directly comparable.
Verification and validation procedures confirm that the approach suits the
objectives. However, accuracy of results is mostly dependent on adequacy
and quality of input data sets. Nevertheless, given the availability of input data
sets for the whole country, it is possible to implement this methodology for
other areas in Portugal.},

Since it is not available on the basis of individual persons, it has become necessary to derive data from aggregated census data. A variety of approaches have been published in the past, yet they are not entirely suitable for use in the micro-scale context of highly urbanized areas, due mainly to their broad spatial scale and missing temporal scale. Here we introduce an enhanced approach for the spatio-temporal estimation of building populations in highly urbanized areas. It builds upon other estimation methodologies, but extends them by introducing multiple usage categories and the temporal dimension. This allows for a more realistic representation of human activities in highly urbanized areas and the fact that populations change over time as a result of these activities. The model makes use of a variety of micro-scale data sets to operationalize the activities and their spatio-temporal representations. The outcome of the model provides estimated population figures for all buildings at each time step and thereby reveals spatio-temporal behavior patterns. It can be used in a variety of applications concerning the implications of human behavior in urban areas.},

Most of the latest work has concentrated on showing the potential of novel data sources like social media, mobile phone data, points of interest, or transportation data for the crime prediction task and researchers have focused mostly on techniques from supervised machine learning to show their predictive potential. Yet, the question remains if indeed this data can be used to better describe urban crime. In this paper, we investigate the potential of data harvested from location-based social networks (specifically Foursquare) to describe urban crime. Towards this end, we apply techniques from spatial econometrics. We show that this data, seen as a measurement for the ambient population of a neighborhood, is able to further describe crime levels in comparison to models built solely on census data, seen as measurement for the resident population of a neighborhood. In an analysis of crime on census tract level in New York City, the total number of incidents can be described by our models with up to R2=56\%R2=56\%R\^2 = 56\textbackslash\%, while the best model for the different crime subtypes is achieved for larcenies with roughly 67\%67\%67\textbackslash\% of the variance explained.},

  abstract = {Similar to every process involving quantitative research, the study of migration heavily depends on the data available for analysis. The available movement data limit the type of questions that can be asked, and as a result, certain aspects of human spatial mobility have yet to be examined. The development of information and communication technologies and their widespread adoption offers new datasets, methods and interpretations that make it possible to study social processes at a new level. For example, mobile positioning data can aid in overcoming certain constraints embedded in traditional data sources (such as censuses or questionnaires) for study of the connections between daily mobility and change of residence. This study presents a framework for mapping changes of residence using data from passive mobile positioning and an anchor point model to better understand the limits of these methods and their contribution to understanding long-term mobility. The study concludes that the most important considerations in monitoring change of residence using passive mobile position data include the continuity of the time-series data, the varying structure of the mobile tower network and the diversified nature of human mobility. The fine spatial and temporal granularities of passive mobile positioning data allow us to study human movement at a detailed scale.},

The resulting population maps are at 50\,m and 5 minutes spatiotemporal resolution, showing clearly how the distribution of population varies throughout a 24-hour period. The maps indicate that some areas of the city, which are sparsely populated during the night, can be densely populated during the day. The developed CA model assumes that the population transition trends follow dynamics and propagation patterns similar to a contagious disease. Thus, our model designed to change the states of each grid cell (stable or dynamic) in a way that is similar to changes in the condition of individuals who are exposed to an infectious disease (susceptible or infected). In addition, the modeling space is informed by several geographic features, such as the transport routes, land-use categories, and population attraction points. The model is geosimulated for the city of Trondheim in Norway, where the synthetic day population could be validated using an estimated day-population map based on the registered workplace addresses and employee statistics. The generated maps can be used to estimate a value for the population-at-risk in the wake of a major disaster that occurs in an urban area at any time of a day. In addition to assessing exposure to hazards, the resulting maps also reveal movement patterns, transition trends, peak hours, and activity levels. Possible applications range from public safety, disaster management, transport modeling, and urban growth studies to strategic energy distribution planning.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach to infer population densities at urban scales, based on aggregated mobile network traffic metadata.

Many geographic studies rely on decennial U.S. Census data that assume that urban populations are static in space and time. This has obvious limitations in the context of dynamic geographic problems. The U.S. Department of Transportation publishes population data at the transportation analysis zone level in fifteen-minute increments. This level of spatial and temporal detail allows for improved dynamic population modeling. This article presents a methodology for visualizing and analyzing diurnal population change for metropolitan areas based on this readily available data. Areal interpolation within a geographic information system is used to create twenty-four (one per hour) population surfaces for the larger metropolitan area of Salt Lake County, Utah. The resulting surfaces represent diurnal population change for an average workday and are easily combined to produce an animation that illustrates population dynamics throughout the day. A case study of using the method to visualize population distributions in an emergency management context is provided using two scenarios: a chemical release and a dirty bomb in Salt Lake County. This methodology can be used to address a wide variety of problems in emergency management.},

This paper investigates a case study and presents a new method of representing the mobility of people within a city from check-in data. By dividing the data in a temporal sequence, this study examines the overall mobility in the case study city through the gradient/difference of population density with a series of time after computing the population density from the check-in data using an incorporated Thiessen polygon method. By classifying check-in data with their geo-tags into several groups according to travel purposes, and partitioning the data according to administrative district boundaries, various moving patterns for those travel purposes in those administrative districts are identified by scrutinizing a series of spatial geometries of a weighted standard deviational ellipse (WSDE). Through deep analyses of those data by the adopted approaches, the general pattern of mobility in the case city, such as people moving to the central urban area from the suburb from 4 am to 8 am, is ascertained, and different characteristics of movement in those districts are also depicted. Furthermore, it can tell that in which district less movement is likely for a certain purpose (e.g., for dinner or entertainment). This study has demonstrated the availability of the proposed methodology and check-in data for investigating intra-urban human mobility.},

  abstract = {This research examines the spatio-temporal distribution of population in an urban environment and its relationship with urban functions using an unprecedented high-resolution and broad-coverage-crowd LBS dataset from Tencent, one of the biggest Internet companies in China. By examining the distribution of the population during different time periods, different urban morphologies are observed. The analysis of the spatio-temporal population distribution based on temporal entropy indicates that population distributions of employment, commercial, and scenic areas have larger temporal fluctuations than those in residential and mixed-use areas. As for the Spearman correlation coefficient between urban functions and temporal population distribution based on 300 \texttimes{} 300-m grids, it is then measured to uncover the underlying reason for this spatio-temporal distribution of population. The result demonstrates that as urban functions become more mixed, the temporal distribution of the population becomes more even. At a local scale, temporal population distribution in key areas shows that the location of people in a certain place is in accordance with human behavior. The population in employment-dominated areas shows large fluctuations on weekdays but is relatively evenly distributed on weekends. The population in commercial areas only peaks for several hours on both weekdays and weekends. Comparatively, mixed areas and large-scale residential communities accommodate a stable number of people at all times.},

a hypothetical example of how the Indigenous service populations of hospitals

  abstract = {The temporal characteristics of human behavior with respect to points of interest (POI) differ significantly with place type. Intuitively, we are more likely to visit a restaurant during typical lunch and dinner times than at midnight. Aggregating geosocial check-ins of millions of users to the place type level leads to powerful temporal bands and signatures. In previous work these signatures have been used to estimate the place being visited based purely on the check-in time, to label uncategorized places based on their individual signature's similarity to a type signature, and to mine POI categories and their hierarchical structure from the bottom up. However, not all hours of the day and days of the week are equally indicative of the place type, i.e., the information gain between temporal bands that jointly form a place type signature differs. To give a concrete example, places can be more easily categorized into weekend and weekday places than into Monday and Tuesday places. Nonetheless, research on the regional variability of temporal signatures is lacking. Intuitively, one would assume that certain types of places are more prone to regional differences with respect to the temporal check-in behavior than others. This variability will impact the predictive power of the signatures and reduce the number of POI types that can be distinguished. In this work, we address the regional variability hypothesis by trying to prove that all place types are created equal with respect to their temporal signatures, i.e., temporal check-in behavior does not change across space. We reject this hypothesis by comparing the inter-signature similarity of 321 place types in three major cities in the USA (Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago). Next, we identify a common core of least varying place types and compare it against signatures extracted from the city of Shanghai, China for cross-culture comparison. Finally, we discuss the impact of our findings on POI categorization and the reliability of temporal signatures for check-in behavior in general.},

population statistics cannot distinguish urban population during the daytime from that at

aspect by establishing a relationship model for the three components of `population, land use

types of population, which is aimed to estimate urban population during the daytime and at
night and to analyze their spatial characteristics at grid scale. Furthermore, an empirical case
study has been carried out at the Haidian District in Beijing, China to test the model. The
results are as follows: (1) The spatial structure of urban population during the daytime is significantly
different from that at night. The spatial distribution of urban population during the
daytime is more extensive and more agglomerated that that at night. (2) Several types of
spatial coupling relationship between population during the daytime and that at night have
been identified, such as sandwich mode, symmetry mode, convergence mode and single
mode, etc. (3) The spatial distribution of daytime and nighttime population also reflects certain
factors during the development of China, such as the distribution of old residential areas, the
construction of new industrial districts, and the differences between urban and rural areas,
which can provide reference points for studies in this field and other regional research.},

Aim of the analysis is to identify subregions of the metropolitan area of Milan sharing a similar pattern along time, and possibly related to activities taking place in specific locations and/or times within the city. To tackle this problem, we develop a non-parametric method for the analysis of spatially dependent functional data, named Bagging Voronoi Treelet analysis. This novel approach integrates the treelet decomposition with a proper treatment of spatial dependence, obtained through a Bagging Voronoi strategy. The latter relies on the aggregation of different replicates of the analysis, each involving a set of functional local representatives associated to random Voronoi-based neighborhoods covering the investigated area. Results clearly point out some interesting temporal patterns interpretable in terms of population density mobility (e.g., daily work activities in the tertiary district, leisure activities in residential areas in the evenings and in the weekend, commuters movements along the highways during rush hours, and localized mob concentrations related to occasional events). Moreover we perform simulation studies, aimed at investigating the properties and performances of the method, and whose description is available online as Supplementary material.},

Using a dasymetric mapping technique, residential populations are estimated by interpolating the census block values to 10 m pixels based on parcel-level land use and density. To determine daytime population estimates, a quantitative employee database gives x,y point locations of each business and exact numbers of how many people are employed within a coastal community.

numbers of people potentially at risk from such events, particularly when societal rather than individual
risk is of concern. To-date, however, the data used on the spatial distribution of populations at risk has
been highly generalised. This project has developed a sophisticated methodology for producing a
national population database, drawing on multiple data sets and including populations located within
residential, workplace, retail, transport and leisure land uses and within communal establishments
involving particularly sensitive populations (such as schools and hospitals). The final database has a
greater coverage of population types and a better level of spatial resolution than any others that
currently exist. It has a flexible and user-friendly interface, which provides for many different potential
uses by HSE and other Government Bodies and Departments.
There were major challenges involved in producing the database including the need for national
coverage, for accuracy at small spatial scales and for representing highly variable patterns of
population concentration over time (for example in retail areas). For these reasons, the population
database has to be approached as a representation of patterns of potential occupation, rather than a
precise measure. Throughout this report, and the user documentation which accompanies the
database, the constraints on the data for different population categories and therefore on how it should
be used are emphasised.

  abstract = {A number of recent studies showed that digital footprints around built environments, such as geo-located tweets, are promising data sources for characterizing urban land use. However, challenges for achieving this purpose exist due to the volume and unstructured nature of geo-located social media. Previous studies focused on analyzing Twitter data collectively resulting in coarse resolution maps of urban land use. We argue that the complex spatial structure of a large collection of tweets, when viewed through the lens of individual-level human mobility patterns, can be simplified to a series of key locations for each user, which could be used to characterize urban land use at a higher spatial resolution. Contingent issues that could affect our approach, such as Twitter users' biases and tendencies at locations where they tweet the most, were systematically investigated using 39 million geo-located Tweets and two independent datasets of the City of Chicago: 1) travel survey and 2) parcel-level land use map. Our results support that the majority of Twitter users show a preferential return, where their digital traces are clustered around a few key locations. However, we did not find a general relation among users between the ranks of locations for an individual\textemdash{}based on the density of tweets\textemdash{}and their land use types. On the contrary, temporal patterns of tweeting at key locations were found to be coherent among the majority of users and significantly associated with land use types of these locations. Furthermore, we used these temporal patterns to classify key locations into generic land use types with an overall classification accuracy of 0.78. The contribution of our research is twofold: a novel approach to resolving land use types at a higher resolution, and in-depth understanding of Twitter users' location-related and temporal biases, promising to benefit human mobility and urban studies in general.},

The differences of population distribution throughout the urban region, especially the differences between night and day distributions, are extreme in most cities, and, therefore, of great importance to a variety of public officials, including transportation planners, highway patrol, and public service officials. The location of resident (night) population is documented through the U.S. census of population. Local metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) usually update such statistics for their own purposes at least every five years.

estimating the De Facto population as well as its components is an important, but not easy task. It is
important because of the many uses for estimates of the De Facto population; it is difficult because
the data that can be used to estimate a De Facto population are skimpy. In an effort to develop this
field of population estimation more fully we provide an equation to define the De Facto population
as well as an example of its use. We describe and discuss each of the components of this equation

The first issue is that of a de Facto population, which is the concept of people enumerated, estimated, or forecasted where they are found rather than where they usually reside. The second is that of the homeless population and the third, a population impacted by a disaster. For both the homeless and those impacted by a disaster, the underlying concept is that of a De Jure population, but in the case of both, the methods for estimating De Jure populations are rendered virtually useless (Rummel, 1991; Smith and McCarty, 1996; Swanson, 2008; US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2008).

This reveals regional urban centres as net recipients of temporary residents while most rural areas experience temporary absenteeism. Secondly, results from household surveys are reported stressing the importance of including visitors to households in the estimation of service populations.

Here, the population quantified from mobile device-based population activity patterns was used to provide dynamic population normalized loads of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals during a known period of high net fluctuation in the catchment population. Mobile device-based population activity patterns have for the first time quantified the high degree of intraday, week, and month variability within a specific sewer catchment. Dynamic population normalization showed that per capita pharmaceutical use remained unchanged during the period when static normalization would have indicated an average reduction of up to 31\%. Per capita illicit drug use increased significantly during the monitoring period, an observation that was only possible to measure using dynamic population normalization. The study quantitatively confirms previous assessments that population estimates can account for uncertainties of up to 55\% in static normalized data.

The movement of population has implications for service delivery and resource allocation. Aboriginal population in the region is characterised by high mobility. We conducted four population surveys in a selected remote community over a 12 month period and categorised individuals into four mutually exclusive groups: residents, dual residents, visitors and absent residents. Based on these categories we developed two population classifications: actual and potential service populations. The potential service population was consistently higher than the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census figure. We question the use of ABS census estimates as appropriate population figures for determining resource allocation to remote communities. We quantify inter\textendash{} and intra\textendash{}community mobility. When the potential population is used as denominator, 35\% of the population of this community was classified as inter\textendash{}community mobile. Given this level of mobility we argue that: (1) Resources should be allocated to compensate health services for the additional time and resource requirements to deal with the high level of population mobility. (2) Health programs such as STD control, trachoma, scabies and other communicable diseases common in Central Australia should be coordinated and delivered as regional programs often crossing State/Territory borders.},

  abstract = {Background
Nearly all official population statistics in Australia refer to the population usually resident in an
area. But for many government, business and research uses it would be helpful to have data on
the de facto population (the population actually present in an area at any one time) and how it
varies seasonally. Unfortunately there are no statistics available for this definition of population.
Aims
This report evaluates 12 data sources to establish whether they could act as useful proxy
indicators of the de facto population in Darwin local government area and how it varies
throughout the year.
Data and methods
Each data source was evaluated against a set of criteria which the ideal data source would satisfy.
Results
Many of the data sources offer partial pictures of the de facto population in Darwin, but none are
perfect. The best data source, at least conceptually, is the Telstra mobile device-based population
numbers, but rubbish collection data and visitor estimates also offer some promise.
Conclusion
Further work is required to investigate the most promising data sources in more detail. This
involves determining if the Telstra data can be obtained, whether more detail is available from
the rubbish collection and visitor data sets, and investigating geocoded social media data.},

Correlations of the human movement and space configurations are interesting observations revealed by space syntax. Much research demonstrates that urban configurations can affect the distribution of human flows in space and even form of land use patterns. The high correlation between the human movement and space structures can lead to the hypothesis that through this high correlation, it is possible to obtain information about a particular type of human activity and the number of people in a region. The present research investigates this possibility and tries to generate models for predicting the number of people who live in a region and the number of people who work in that region.},

  volume = {38},
  issn = {0143-1161},
  abstract = {As urban populations rapidly rise worldwide, it is increasingly necessary to determine the accurate distribution and configuration of the population in order to appropriate resources and services. Census-based methods for obtaining population counts are time consuming, labour intensive, and costly. Researchers have turned to remote sensing to estimate population from aerial and satellite datasets including lidar, which allows measures of building volume to be incorporated into population estimates. However, studies using lidar-derived building volumes have noted inconsistencies between population and building volume estimates in certain areas. In this article, we investigate this issue by incorporating both static and ambient population data into models using the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database. To do this, we first develop a normalized home\textendash{}work index to classify census blocks as primarily work-oriented, home-oriented, or mixed-use based on the LEHD data. We then employ ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explore the relationships between the different population groups (work, home, and mixed) and lidar-derived building volumes. We test these relationships across four diverse cities in Texas: Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Results suggest non-stationarity in the relationship between building volume and population with stronger, positive relationships in home-oriented and mixed-use blocks where the amount of building volume per person may be more consistent compared to work-oriented blocks. GWR models yielded high R2 values (0.9), particularly in mixed-use areas, indicating the potential for predictive relationships.},

  abstract = {City-scale events attract large amounts of attendees in temporarily re-purposed urban environments. In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in \textendash{} or moving through \textendash{} the event terrain is central to applications such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g. sensor networks, mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behaviour during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose 3 classes of density estimation strategies, i.e. geo-based, speed-based and flow-based strategy, inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of 5 days and 1 day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, a- d limited mean errors.},

  abstract = {The rapid, unplanned urbanisation in Haiti creates a series of urban mobility challenges which can contribute to job market fragmentation and decrease the quality of life in the city. Data on population and job distributions, and on home-work commuting patterns in major urban centres are scarce. The most recent census took place in 2003 and events such as the 2010 earthquake have caused major redistributions of the population. In this data scarce context, our work takes advantage of nationwide de-identified Call Detail Records (CDR) from the main mobile operator in the country to investigate night and daytime populations densities and commuting patterns. We use a non-supervised learning algorithm to identify meaningful locations for individuals. These locations are then labelled according to a scoring criteria. The labelled locations are distributed in a grid with cells measuring 500 \texttimes{} 500 m in order to aggregate the individual level data and to create origin-destination matrices of weighted connections between home and work locations. The results suggest that labor markets are fragmented in Haiti. The two main urban centres, Port-au-Prince and Cap-Ha{\"i}tien suffer from low employment accessibility as measured by the percentage of the population that travels beyond their identified home cluster (1 km radius) during the day. The data from the origin-destination matrices suggest that only 42 and 40 percent of the population are considered to be commuters in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Ha{\"i}tien respectively.},

  abstract = {Rapid urbanization is placing increasing stress on already burdened transportation infrastructure. Ubiquitous mobile computing and the massive data it generates presents new opportunities to measure the demand for this infrastructure, diagnose problems, and plan for the future. However, before these benefits can be realized, methods and models must be updated to integrate these new data sources into existing urban and transportation planning frameworks for estimating travel demand and infrastructure usage. While recent work has made great progress extracting valid and useful measurements from new data resources, few present end-to-end solutions that transform and integrate raw, massive data into estimates of travel demand and infrastructure performance. Here we present a flexible, modular, and computationally efficient software system to fill this gap. Our system estimates multiple aspects of travel demand using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile phones in conjunction with open- and crowdsourced geospatial data, census records, and surveys. We bring together numerous existing and new algorithms to generate representative origin\textendash{}destination matrices, route trips through road networks constructed using open and crowd-sourced data repositories, and perform analytics on the system's output. We also present an online, interactive visualization platform to communicate these results to researchers, policy makers, and the public. We demonstrate the flexibility of this system by performing analyses on multiple cities around the globe. We hope this work will serve as unified and comprehensive guide to integrating new big data resources into customary transportation demand modeling.},

These algorithms are presented and cross compared in terms of performance, data usage and practical applications, based on the empirical data collected from this large-scale event.

In this paper, we focus on local and global real-time measurements, collected during the SAIL Amsterdam event using counting cameras, Wi-Fi sensors and GPS trackers. The counting cameras gave accurate local counts, but did not have route information. The latter was given by Wi-Fi sensors and GPS trackers. However, the penetration rate for Wi-Fi sensors was low, so to get accurate data these sensors can only be used with large visitor numbers. GPS trackers gave detailed, but not continuous information. Based on the joint datasources, counts, travel times, density and flow are estimated. This way, we could provide the real-time information necessary for crowd management.},

Understanding and predicting accurately such a large amount of data could benefit many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for prediction of spatial-temporal activities such as human mobility, especially the inflow and outflow of people in urban environments based on existing large-scale mobility datasets. Our methodology first identifies and quantifies the latent characteristics of different spatial environments and temporal factors through tensor factorization. Our hypothesis is that the patterns of spatial-temporal activities are highly dependent on or caused by these latent spatial-temporal features. We model this hidden dependent relationship as a Gaussian process, which can be viewed as a distribution over the possible functions to predict human mobility. We tested our proposed methodology through experiments conducted on a case study of New York City's taxi trips and focused on the mobility patterns of spatial-temporal inflow and outflow across different spatial areas and temporal time periods. The results of the experiments verify our hypothesis and show that our prediction methodology achieves a much higher accuracy than other existing methodologies.},

These movements must be determined for a range of purposes, and strong interactions can be visually represented via clustering of OD flows. Identification of such clusters may be useful in urban planning, traffic planning and logistics management research. However, few methods can identify arbitrarily shaped flow clusters. Here, we present a spatial scan statistical approach based on ant colony optimization (ACO) for detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters of OD flows (AntScan\_flow). In this study, an OD flow cluster is defined as a regional pair with significant log likelihood ratio (LLR), and the ACO is employed to detect the clusters with maximum LLRs in the search space. Simulation experiments based on AntScan\_flow and SaTScan\_flow show that AntScan\_flow yields better performance based on accuracy but requires a large computational demand. Finally, a case study of the morning commuting flows of Beijing residents was conducted. The AntScan\_flow results show that the regions associated with moderate- and long-distance commuting OD flow clusters are highly consistent with subway lines and highways in the city. Additionally, the regions of short-distance commuting OD flow clusters are more likely to exhibit `residential-area to work-area' patterns.},

In order to efficiently evaluate which are the most appropriate policies to reduce the impact of urban pollution sources (such as road traffic), it is essential to conduct rigorous population exposure assessments. One of the main limitations associated with those studies is the lack of information about population distribution in the city along the day (population dynamics). The pervasive use of mobile devices in our daily lives opens new opportunities to gather large amounts of anonymized and passively collected geolocation data allowing the analysis of population activity and mobility patterns. This study presents a novel methodology to estimate population dynamics from mobile phone data based on a user-centric mobility model approach. The methodology was tested in the city of Madrid (Spain) to evaluate population exposure to NO2. A comparison with traditional census-based methods shows relevant discrepancies at disaggregated levels and highlights the need to incorporate mobility patterns into population exposure assessments.},

However, conventional tourism research methods are not either scalable or cost-efficient to discover underlying movement patterns due to the massive datasets. With advances in information and communication technology, social media platforms provide big data sets generated by millions of people from different countries, all of which can be harvested cost efficiently. This paper introduces a graph-based method to detect tourist movement patterns from Twitter data. First, collected tweets with geo-tags are cleaned to filter those not published by tourists. Second, a DBSCAN-based clustering method is adapted to construct tourist graphs consisting of the tourist attraction vertices and edges. Third, network analytical methods (e.g. betweenness centrality, Markov clustering algorithm) are applied to detect tourist movement patterns, including popular attractions, centric attractions, and popular tour routes. New York City in the United States is selected to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methodology. The detected tourist movement patterns assist business and government activities whose mission is tour product planning, transportation, and development of both shopping and accommodation centers.},

  abstract = {The demand for building occupancy estimation continues to grow in a wide array of application domains, such as population distribution modeling, green building technologies, public safety, and natural hazards loss analytics. While much has been gained in using survey diaries, sensor technologies, and dasymetric modeling, the volume and velocity of social media data provide a unique opportunity to measure and model occupancy patterns with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. If successful, patterns or occupancy curves could describe the fluctuations in population across a 24 h period for a single building or a class of building types. Although social media hold great promise in responding to this need, a number of challenges exist regarding representativeness and fitness for purpose that, left unconsidered, could lead to erroneous conclusions about true building occupancy. As a mode of discussion, this chapter presents an explicit social media model that assists in delineating and articulating the specific challenges and limitations of using social media. It concludes by proposing a research agenda for further work and engagement in this domain.},

  title = {Inferencing {{Human Spatiotemporal Mobility}} in {{Greater Maputo}} via {{Mobile Phone Big Data Mining}}},
  volume = {7},

  abstract = {The mobility patterns and trip behavior of people are usually extracted from data collected by traditional survey methods. However, these methods are generally costly and difficult to implement, especially in developing cities with limited resources. The massive amounts of call detail record (CDR) data passively generated by ubiquitous mobile phone usage provide researchers with the opportunity to innovate alternative methods that are inexpensive and easier and faster to implement than traditional methods. This paper proposes a method based on proven techniques to extract the origin\&ndash;destination (OD) trips from the raw CDR data of mobile phone users and process the data to capture the mobility of those users. The proposed method was applied to 3.4 million mobile phone users over a 12-day period in Mozambique, and the data processed to capture the mobility of people living in the Greater Maputo metropolitan area in different time frames (weekdays and weekends). Subsequently, trip generation maps, attraction maps, and the OD matrix of the study area, which are all practically usable for urban and transportation planning, were generated. Furthermore, spatiotemporal interpolation was applied to all OD trips to reconstruct the population distribution in the study area on an average weekday and weekend. Comparison of the results obtained with actual survey results from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) indicate that the proposed method achieves acceptable accuracy. The proposed method and study demonstrate the efficacy of mining big data sources, particularly mobile phone CDR data, to infer the spatiotemporal human mobility of people in a city and understand their flow pattern, which is valuable information for city planning.},

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for the estimation of people density at metropolitan scales, using subscriber presence metadata collected by a mobile operator. Our approach suits the estimation of static population densities, i.e., of the distribution of dwelling units per urban area contained in traditional censuses. More importantly, it enables the estimation of dynamic population densities, i.e., the time-varying distributions of people in a conurbation. By leveraging substantial real-world mobile network metadata and ground-truth information, we demonstrate that the accuracy of our solution is superior to that granted by state-of-the-art methods in practical heterogeneous urban scenarios.},

  abstract = {Population estimation typically involves counting a group of individuals at a specific place and time. Estimating people on the move, i.e. a mobile population, is an intellectual challenge both in theory and in practice. The research objective is to develop a framework to estimate mobile population by simulating crowd behaviors based on crowdsourced data. The framework includes the following steps: (1) collecting and analyzing small area population movements (i.e. density and walking speed) from crowdsourced pictures and trajectories; (2) reconstructing the mobile population dynamics during a rally using a GIS; and (3) simulating the mobile population by using agent-based modeling. In this model, each individual is encoded as an agent with associated rules to define their crowd behaviors in walking, stopping, and personal spacing. Each agent moves toward the cell with next lowest distance if the occupying capacity of the cell area has not exceeded the crowd density at that time. By simulating crowd movements and behaviors, crowd size can be estimated by comparing the simulation time with observed rally time taken by the real crowd. The intellectual merits and research findings shed useful insights to improve mobile population estimation, and leverage alternative data sources to support related scientific applications.},

  abstract = {Tourist flows in historical cities are continuously growing in a globalized world and adequate governance processes, politics and tools are necessary in order to reduce impacts on the urban livability and to guarantee the preservation of cultural heritage. The ICTs offer the possibility of collecting large amount of data that can point out and quantify some statistical and dynamic properties of human mobility emerging from the individual behavior and referring to a whole road network. In this paper we analyze a new dataset that has been collected by the Italian mobile phone company TIM, which contains the GPS positions of a relevant sample of mobile devices when they actively connected to the cell phone network. Our aim is to propose innovative tools allowing to study properties of pedestrian mobility on the whole road network. Venice is a paradigmatic example for the impact of tourist flows on the resident life quality and on the preservation of cultural heritage. The GPS data provide anonymized georeferenced information on the displacements of the devices. After a filtering procedure, we develop specific algorithms able to reconstruct the daily mobility paths on the whole Venice road network. The statistical analysis of the mobility paths suggests the existence of a travel time budget for the mobility and points out the role of the rest times in the empirical relation between the mobility time and the corresponding path length. We succeed to highlight two connected mobility subnetworks extracted from the whole road network, that are able to explain the majority of the observed mobility. Our approach shows the existence of characteristic mobility paths in Venice for the tourists and for the residents. Moreover the data analysis highlights the different mobility features of the considered case studies and it allows to detect the mobility paths associated to different points of interest. Finally we have disaggregated the Italian and foreigner categories to study their different mobility behaviors.},

  abstract = {Shenzhen is the most densely populated city in China.In order to respond to emergencies,such as natural disasters,real time high resolution dynamic information of population distribution is needed.This paper analyzes the fine grid dynamic characteristics of Shenzhen population distribution,using the information of population density in respect of which the temporal resolution is an hour and the spatial resolution is a kilometer provided by the "Dynamic Monitoring System of Population Distribution Based on Mobile Stations".The mobile subscribers in Shenzhen total to 10.8259 million.The average population density is 5545 people/km2,and the maximum density reaches 165,000 people/km2.High density areas which have more than 50,000 people/km2 are mainly the business centers,custom ports,railway stations,and large residential communities.The value of the maximum population density depends on the size of grid used,for example the value of 1 km2 grid is about 18 times than the value of 1000 km2 grid.Some 50\% of the population in Shenzhen is concentrated in 10\% of the city's spatial area,and 60\% resides in the areas where altitudes are between 50 m to 100 m.The building density and the road density on the grid are linearly correlated with population density,that is,1000 people are added when the building density increases by 1\%,and about 2,000 people are added when the road density increases by 0.01\%.The total population of a city is relatively stable during a period of time,the variation of which is commonly less than 4\% and the daily variation is about 1\%.Shenzhen is a typical immigration city,and the total population will decrease by 48\% during the Chinese New Year because a lot of people will go back to their hometowns or traval around.This paper selects 9 typical grids to analyze the daily variation of the population and they are as follows:custom ports have a morning peak,and people going outbound crowd here at about 8 a.m.;bazaar areas have a noon peak;business centers have an evening peak with a net inflow/outflow over 20,000 people/hr;residential communities have a noon trough,and the density of population is always bigger on the weekends than on the weekdays;in the government offices and public service areas,there are fewer people on the weekends than on the weekdays and the population is decreased by 75\% during the Chinese New Year;the factory area has a peak of population at about 4 a.m.because of the peak load shifting;outing area is more crowded during the holidays and weekends;in the out-of-the-way area,the daily variation of population is very little;and in the farming area,there is a morning trough of population at about 9 a.m.which corresponds to the traditional farming habits.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the usage of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth based sensors for pedestrian counting in urban areas

An improvement of the pedestrian infrastructure, as well as a higher amount of people walking in inner city areas are desirable. Pedestrian volumes are one of the key performances to argue for an enhancement of walkability.

Unfortunately, information about the amount of pedestrians, walking in urban areas are regularly based on annual counting's or traffic model estimations, which are often insufficient for the increasing needs of sustainable inner city infrastructure planning. Automatic measurement systems like infra-red beams or cameras are mostly used and designed for indoor environments like shopping malls or airports. The growing number of mobile devices, equipped with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi interfaces, creates new possibilities in pedestrians' data collection in indoor and outdoor situations. An automatic, cost effective pedestrian counting approach, operating with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth data to acquire pedestrian information is highly welcomed. 

The research question of this study is, whether the usage of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensors is suitable for estimating the amount of pedestrians in different inner city areas in a reliable way. The used BlipTrack system is a measurement instrument which detects unique Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Media-Access-Control (MAC) addresses, sent from mobile phones, headsets or other hardware devices.
First, a controlled test is arranged to validate the measurement equipment. In a second phase several field tests are performed and the characteristics of different locations, like bridges, pedestrian zones and arterial main roads are evaluated.

The generated data is analyzed in terms of its penetration rate in different locations and to different times, such as peak an non peak hours. To investigate the penetration rate, a comparison to manual counts is required. The results may show different characteristics depending on the regarded location, and to different times of the day. Filter techniques, like speed ranges or characteristically movement behaviors of the different road users support the distinguishing between pedestrians, cyclists or cars. The measure system is examined and discussed in case of its reliability, the further usage and its restrictions.},

This data collection requires more carefully developed methodologies for counting pedestrians as well as improved methods of modeling pedestrian volumes. The methodology used to create a simple pilot model of pedestrian intersection crossing volumes in Alameda County, California, is described. The model is based on weekly pedestrian volumes at a sample of 50 intersections with a wide variety of surrounding land uses, transportation system attributes, and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. Three alternative model structures were considered, and the final recommended model has a good overall fit (adjusted R2 = .897). Statistically significant factors in the model include the total population within a 0.5-mi radius, number of jobs within a 0.25-mi radius, number of commercial retail properties within a 0.25-mi radius, and the presence of a regional transit station within a 0.1-mi radius of an intersection. The model has a simple structure, and it can be implemented by practitioners using geographic information systems and a basic spreadsheet program. Because the study is based on a relatively small number of intersections in one urban area, additional research is needed to refine the model and determine its applicability in other areas.},

  abstract = {The San Francisco pedestrian volume modeling process refined the methodology used to develop previous intersection-based models and incorporated variables that were tailored to estimate walking activity in the local urban context. The methodology included two main steps. First, manual and automated pedestrian counts were taken at a sample of 50 study intersections with a variety of characteristics. A series of factor adjustments were applied to produce an annual pedestrian crossing estimate at each intersection. Second, log-linear regression modeling was used to identify statistically-significant relationships between the annual pedestrian volume estimate and land use, transportation system, local environment, and socioeconomic characteristics near each intersection. Twelve alternative models were considered, and the preferred model had a good overall fit (adjusted-R 2= 0.804). As identified in other communities, pedestrian volumes were positively associated with the number of households and the number of jobs near each intersection. Uniquely, this San Francisco model also found significantly higher pedestrian volumes at intersections in high-activity zones with metered on-street parking, in areas with fewer hills, near university campuses, and controlled by traffic signals. The model was based on a relatively small sample of intersections, so the number of significant factors was limited to six. Results are being used by public agencies in San Francisco to better understand pedestrian crossing risk and to inform citywide pedestrian safety policy and investment.},

However, reflections on data quality lead to concerns about inaccurate or even erroneous spatial analysis results. This article contributes a meta-analysis of big data-enabled social sensing in spatial analysis. Big data-enabled research has substantially enhanced our understanding of human population distribution and dynamics, land use, travel behavior, movement patterns, and spatial social networks from city to country to global levels. However, the effectiveness of big data-enabled social sensing can be undermined by five critical issues related to research design: data volume, spatial coverage, locational information quality, and representativeness across socioeconomic and demographic groups. We suggest a framework for addressing the inherent bias in spatial big data at multiple stages of the research lifecycle and applying them to appropriate topics and scales of applications.},

Second, we assess whether a high-frequency variable (weekly Google Trends) is more useful for accurate forecasting than a low-frequency variable (monthly tourist arrivals) using Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS). Our results stress the potential of Google Trends to offer more accurate prediction in the context of tourism: we find that Google Trends information, both two months and one week ahead of arrivals, is useful for predicting the actual number of tourist arrivals. The MIDAS forecasting model that employs weekly Google Trends data outperforms models using monthly Google Trends data and models without Google Trends data.},

Emergency management needs demand forecasting by understanding the major demands during a disaster event. Mobile phone traffic is useful for understanding the demands because the behavioral dataset from typical surveys for ordinary demand pattern is impractical. The aim of our spatio-temporal analysis is to identify the characteristics of the population density after a disaster. To deal with this problem, we apply the latest spatial statistic approach to the aggregated mobile phone data before and after a disaster. A regression analysis clarifies the effect of the damage based on the result obtained by this approach. Our case study analyzes the population density before and after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. We confirm that this approach can identify the main characteristics: commuting transitions during morning and recreation population on the weekend using the data before the earthquake. The results clearly highlight some interesting spatio-temporal patterns after the earthquake: the recovery process of daily life and time variation of the refugee population density.},

  abstract = {Air pollution imposes significant environmental and health risks worldwide and is expected to deteriorate in the coming decade as cities expand. Measuring population exposure to air pollution is crucial to quantifying risks to public health. In this work, we introduce a big data analytics framework to model residents' stay and commuters' travel exposure to outdoor PM2.5 and evaluate their environmental justice, with Beijing as an example. Using mobile phone and census data, we first infer travel demand of the population to derive residents' stay activities in each analysis zone, and then focus on commuters and estimate their travel routes with a traffic assignment model. Based on air quality observations from monitoring stations and a spatial interpolation model, we estimate the outdoor PM2.5 concentrations at a 500-m grid level and map them to road networks. We then estimate the travel exposure for each road segment by multiplying the PM2.5 concentration and travel time spent on the road. By combining the estimated PM2.5 exposure and housing price harnessed from online housing transaction platforms, we discover that in the winter, Beijing commuters with low wealth level are exposed to 13\% more PM2.5 per hour than those with high wealth level when staying at home, but exposed to less PM2.5 by 5\% when commuting the same distance (due to lighter traffic congestion in suburban areas). We also find that the residents from the southern suburbs of Beijing have both lower level of wealth and higher stay- and travel- exposure to PM2.5, especially in the winter. These findings inform more equitable environmental mitigation policies for future sustainable development in Beijing. Finally, or the first time in the literature, we compare the results of exposure estimated from passive data with subjective measures of perceived air quality (PAQ) from a survey. The PAQ data was collected via a mobile-app. The comparison confirms consistencies in results and the advantages of the big data for air pollution exposure assessments.},

Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective earthquake casualty assessment methods for pre-disaster preparedness and emergency management. However, there are many problems with existing approaches to earthquake casualty assessment in China. This study developed an improved earthquake casualty assessment methodology by incorporating the estimation of population exposure at a more appropriate spatiotemporal scale, the locally oriented damage probability matrices, and the quantitative relationship between casualties and building damage. The proposed methodology can improve the spatial and temporal accuracy and the speed of earthquake casualty evaluation on a large scale. Through a case study of Haidian District in Beijing, we used this methodology to estimate the daytime and nighttime casualties at the 500 m \texttimes{} 500 m grid and block scale. Our proposed model was able to identify areas where earthquake casualties were likely to be higher, necessitating higher priority for pre-disaster mitigation, preparedness, and emergency response activities. It is expected that the model will be used to evaluate earthquake casualties in other parts of China.},

Most official work in this area utilizes real traffic data such as vehicle trajectories collected by mobile/fixed sensors on vehicles or at the roadside respectively. However such data are expensive to collect and often unavailable for researchers. In this paper, we explore whether freely available social media data can be used for traffic analysis by comparing the association between official traffic data and social media data patterns on the road network of Melbourne. Given the high volume and high velocity of traffic data, this requires Cloud-based data processing pipelines and associated data models to explore the spatio-temporal relationship between social media data and real traffic data. We identify that social media data can indeed act as a cheaper proxy for more official traffic data sets that are collected by official Government agencies.},

  abstract = {Seasonal population has a widespread impact on economic, political and environmental aspects in a region. Since the variation of seasonal population is not constant throughout the country, it is essential to assess the population shifts at local levels. This study introduces the concept of ``equivalent residents'' as a unit of measurement which represents visitor equivalencies to permanent residents and hence, assesses population shifts at the county level in the state of North Carolina. The adopted methodology utilized sales tax data by the North Carolina Department of Revenue and the permanent population data as certified to the Secretary of Revenue by the State Budget Officer to calculate the number of equivalent residents. This was calculated for each county on a monthly basis for five-year period (2012\textendash{}2016). The results were then analyzed in terms of magnitude, geographic region and seasonality at county, regional and state level. The study concluded that on an average, the proportion of equivalent residents to permanent residents in North Carolina across five years is 0.11, with the coastal region experiencing maximum equivalent residents influx followed by the mountains and the piedmont region. It was also noted that the population influx of equivalent residents is not constant throughout the year and hence, peak and off peak seasons of each county were defined. 80\% of the counties in North Carolina encounter seasonality with the most prominent season being summer season. The study highlights the need to assess seasonal population influx in North Carolina for the efficient allocation of funds and accurate distribution of resources throughout the state.},

The two major challenges we face in using these probe requests for estimating human activity are: filtering the noise generated by the uncertain field of measurement and clustering anonymised probe requests generated by the same devices together without compromising the privacy of the users. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can overcome these challenges by using class intervals and a novel graph-based technique for filtering and clustering the probe requests which in turn, enables us to reliably measure real-time pedestrian footfall at retail high streets.},

  abstract = {Statistics on internal migration are important for keeping estimates of subnational population numbers up-to-date, as well as urban planning, infrastructure development, and impact assessment, among other applications. However, migration flow statistics typically remain constrained by the logistics of infrequent censuses or surveys. The penetration rate of mobile phones is now high across the globe with rapid recent increases in ownership in low-income countries. Analyzing the changing spatiotemporal distribution of mobile phone users through anonymized call detail records (CDRs) offers the possibility to measure migration at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Based on a dataset of 72 billion anonymized CDRs in Namibia from October 2010 to April 2014, we explore how internal migration estimates can be derived and modeled from CDRs at subnational and annual scales, and how precision and accuracy of these estimates compare to census-derived migration statistics. We also demonstrate the use of CDRs to assess how migration patterns change over time, with a finer temporal resolution compared with censuses. Moreover, we show how gravity-type spatial interaction models built using CDRs can accurately capture migration flows. The results highlight that estimates of migration flows made using mobile phone data is a promising avenue for complementing more traditional national migration statistics and obtaining more timely and local data.},

In this paper, we describe how such models can be dynamically calibrated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a standard method of data assimilation. Our goal is twofold. First, we want to present the EnKF in a simple setting for the benefit of ABM practitioners who are unfamiliar with it. Second, we want to illustrate to data assimilation experts the value of using such methods in the context of ABMs of complex social systems and the new challenges these types of model present. We work towards these goals within the context of a simple question of practical value: how many people are there in Leeds (or any other major city) right now? We build a hierarchy of exemplar models that we use to demonstrate how to apply the EnKF and calibrate these using open data of footfall counts in Leeds.},

  abstract = {The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the UK's largest independent producer of official statistics and is the recognised national statistical institute for the UK. It is responsible for collecting and publishing statistics related to the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels. It also conducts the census in England and Wales every ten years. ONS also plays a leading role in national and international good practice in the production of official statistics. To maintain and further its expertise, the ONS conducts and commissions research covering key topics relating to official statistics and encompassing key emerging conditions. One emerging change relates to the new data sources becoming available through the growth of technologies such as the Internet. These data sources might have a role in official statistics in a number of ways such as helping to validate or improve official estimates, providing more timely information on trends or reducing costs and response burden through the diminishing need to collect data through normal survey processes. One new data source of interest to statistical organisations around the world is the high frequency electricity data recorded by domestic smart meters. Such data may help with understanding energy use and expenditure as well as various features such as occupancy status or household size which may be inferred from the profile of energy use over time. All constituent countries of the UK have programs to roll out smart meters to domestic dwellings by 2020, so that information on an almost universal coverage of dwellings may be available from this date. Energy trials using smart-type meter devices have led to the availability of data on smaller numbers of dwellings for current research and ONS has commissioned the University of Southampton to use some of these trial datasets to test the feasibility of using this data to identify features of households which may have relevance for official statistics. Specifically, this research focuses on the potential of using smart-type meter data to identify household characteristics such as the presence of retired occupants. A second objective is the development of a method to determine occupancy status. It must be emphasised that the principal interest for ONS is the development of methods to derive estimates for groups of households so as to monitor broad trends whilst ensuring no disclosure of personal information. As a first step towards this aim, it is necessary to conduct research at the individual household level as within this paper. ONS recognises that smart meter data poses major questions around ethics, privacy and the safeguarding of personal information. ONS has already sought advice from privacy groups on this research and been given approval so as to demonstrate more fully the benefits of using this data. Future use of this data in a production setting will involve extensive engagement with all stakeholders to ensure that the appropriate levels of security are in place to satisfy the strict controls demanded under the code of practice for official statistics (UK Statistics Authority 2009). The University of Southampton is continuing this research under an ESRC funded project (http://www.energy.soton.ac.uk/category/research/energy-behaviour/census-2022/). Additionally, ONS is conducting internal research using smart-type meter data through its Big Data project and regular updates are published at http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guidemethod/development-programmes/the-ons-big-data-project/index.html},

In this paper, we firstly propose a model that describes the number of people staying inside/outside of buildings by considering the population density that varies according to the use of building, time, and local characteristics, by using GIS database and Mobile Spatial Statistics (MSS) which is one of the population statistics of mobile phone users. Next, we integrate the MSS data and the Person Trip survey data (PT data) which include detailed personal attributes as well as the purpose of stay. Using the integrated database, we demonstrate the advanced use of population statistics based on mobile phone users by addition of purpose of stay which varies according to building use.},

  abstract = {The ambient population, i.e. the demographics and volume of people in a particular location throughout the day, has been studied less than the night-time residential population. Although the spatio-temporal behaviour of some groups, such as commuters, are captured in sources such as population censuses, much less is known about groups such as retired people who have less documented behaviour patterns. This paper uses agent-based modelling to disaggregate some ambient population data to estimate the size and demographics of the constituent populations during the day. This is accomplished by first building a model of commuters to model typical 9\textendash{}5 workday patterns. The differences between the model outputs and real footfall data (the error) can be an indication of the contributions that other groups make to the overall footfall. The research then iteratively simulates a wider range of demographic groups, maximising the correspondence between the model and data at each stage. An application of this methodology to the town centre of Otley, West Yorkshire, UK, is presented. Ultimately this approach could lead to a better understanding about how town- and city-centres are used by residents and visitors, contributing useful information in a situation where raw data on the populations do not exist.},

Through gathering residents daily mobility among 299 cities in China during the period of ``National Day\textendash{}Mid-Autumn Festival'' (NDMAF) vacation (from September 30 to October 8) in 2017 in ``Tencent Migration'' and defining three periods with ``travel period, journey period, return period'', this paper is designed to analyze and explore the characteristics and spatial patterns of daily flow mobility cities from the perspective of population daily mobility distribution levels, flow distribution layers network aggregation, spatial patterns and characteristics of the complex structure of the flow network. Results show that ``Tencent migration'' big data clearly discovers the temporal-spatial pattern of population mobility in China during the period of NDMAF. The net inflow of population showed a diamond shaped with cross frame support in each period, the four nodes of the diamond contain Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an. Main mobility assembling centers are distributed in the urban agglomerations of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing, and those centers have strong coherence with those urban hierarchies. Most cities are in a state of ``relative equilibrium'' in the population flow, and clear hierarchical structure and level distinction can be identified. Spatial patterns of population mobility present obvious core-periphery structures. The Dali-Hegang line exhibits a significant network of spatial differences in terms of boundary divisions. In this context, the spatial distribution of urban network could be summarized as ``dense in the East and sparse in the West'', and the core linkages of urban network could be characterized as ``parallel in the East and series in the West''. The whole network exhibits a typical ``small world'' network characteristic, which shows that China's urban population flow network has high connectivity and accessibility during the period of NDMAF. The network has a distinct ``community'' structure in the local area, including 2 national communities, 2 regional communities and 3 local-level communities.},

  abstract = {Recent air quality studies have highlighted that important differences in pollutant concentrations can occur over the day and between different locations. Traditional exposure analyses, however, assume that people are only exposed to pollution at their place of residence. Activity-based models, which recently have emerged from the field of transportation research, offer a technique to micro-simulate activity patterns of a population with a high resolution in space and time. Due to their characteristics, this model can be applied to establish a dynamic exposure assessment to air pollution. This paper presents a new exposure methodology, using a micro-simulator of activity\textendash{}travel behaviour, to develop a dynamic exposure assessment. The methodology is applied to a Dutch urban area to demonstrate the advantages of the approach for exposure analysis. The results for the exposure to PM10 and PM2.5, air pollutants considered as hazardous for human health, reveal large differences between the static and the dynamic approach, mainly due to an underestimation of the number of hours spent in the urban region by the static method. We can conclude that this dynamic population modelling approach is an important improvement over traditional methods and offers a new and more sensitive way for estimating population exposure to air pollution. In the light of the new European directive, aimed at reducing the exposure of the population to PM2.5, this new approach contributes to a much more accurate exposure assessment that helps evaluate policies to reduce public exposure to air pollution.},

  abstract = {Extremely high fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration has been a topic of special concern in recent years because of its important and sensitive relation with health risks. However, many previous PM2.5 exposure assessments have practical limitations, due to the assumption that population distribution or air pollution levels are spatially stationary and temporally constant and people move within regions of generally the same air quality throughout a day or other time periods. To deal with this challenge, we propose a novel method to achieve the real-time estimation of population exposure to PM2.5 in China by integrating mobile-phone locating-request (MPL) big data and station-based PM2.5 observations. Nationwide experiments show that the proposed method can yield the estimation of population exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cumulative inhaled PM2.5 masses with a 3-h updating frequency. Compared with the census-based method, it introduced the dynamics of population distribution into the exposure estimation, thereby providing an improved way to better assess the population exposure to PM2.5 at different temporal scales. Additionally, the proposed method and dataset can be easily extended to estimate other ambient pollutant exposures such as PM10, O3, SO2, and NO2, and may hold potential utilities in supporting the environmental exposure assessment and related policy-driven environmental actions.},

Transportation policies have an impact on both concentration levels and mobility patterns. The impact of a fuel price increase policy on population exposure to elemental carbon (EC) was evaluated and compared to the base scenario (current situation), taking into account time-activity patterns \textendash{} including time in commute. We assessed the effect on exposure of both the change in concentrations and whereabouts. The decrease in exposure due to the fuel price increase using residential information only was limited to areas near highways and urban centres. Integrating population movement, exposures to EC were higher and the decrease in exposure was no longer limited to areas near traffic hotspots. For inhabitants of urban areas, the exposure integrating time-activity patterns was more similar to the residential exposure, as they spent more time in their own neighbourhood. For people living further away from traffic hotspots, the estimated impact of the policy was higher than expected for residential exposure. These people profited both from the higher decrease in concentrations at their work/shop/leisure destinations in more urban areas and, as they have to travel longer, also had a larger gain from the high decrease in concentrations during transport. Therefore, the impact of changing concentrations is underestimated when using residential exposure only. These results show the importance of taking into activity-travel patterns when planning future actions.},

  abstract = {Air pollution epidemiologic and health impact studies often rely on home addresses to estimate individual subject's pollution exposure. In this study, we used detailed cell phone location data, the call detail record (CDR), to account for the impact of spatiotemporal subject mobility on estimates of ambient air pollutant exposure. This approach was applied on a sample with 9886 unique simcard IDs in Shenzhen, China, on one mid-week day in October 2013. Hourly ambient concentrations of six chosen pollutants were simulated by the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model fused with observational data, and matched with detailed location data for these IDs. The results were compared with exposure estimates using home addresses to assess potential exposure misclassification errors. We found the misclassifications errors are likely to be substantial when home location alone is applied. The CDR based approach indicates that the home based approach tends to over-estimate exposures for subjects with higher exposure levels and under-estimate exposures for those with lower exposure levels. Our results show that the cell phone location based approach can be used to assess exposure misclassification error and has the potential for improving exposure estimates in air pollution epidemiology studies.},

  abstract = {City-scale mass gatherings attract hundreds of thousands of pedestrians. These pedestrians need to be monitored constantly to detect critical crowd situations at an early stage and to mitigate the risk that situations evolve towards dangerous incidents. Hereby, the crowd density is an important characteristic to assess the criticality of crowd situations.In this work, we consider location-aware smartphones for monitoring crowds during mass gatherings as an alternative to established video-based solutions. We follow a participatory sensing approach in which pedestrians share their locations on a voluntary basis. As participation is voluntarily, we can assume that only a fraction of all pedestrians shares location information. This raises a challenge when concluding about the crowd density. We present a methodology to infer the crowd density even if only a limited set of pedestrians share their locations. Our methodology is based on the assumption that the walking speed of pedestrians depends on the crowd density. By modeling this behavior, we can infer a crowd density estimation.We evaluate our methodology with a real-world data set collected during the Lord Mayor's Show 2011 in London. This festival attracts around half a million spectators and we obtained the locations of 828 pedestrians. With this data set, we first verify that the walking speed of pedestrians depends on the crowd density. In particular, we identify a crowd density-dependent upper limit speed with which pedestrians move through urban spaces. We then evaluate the accuracy of our methodology by comparing our crowd density estimates to ground truth information obtained from video cameras used by the authorities. We achieve an average calibration error of 0.36 m-20.36 m-2Open image in new window{$<$}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}semantics{$><$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mn{$>$}0.36{$<$}/mn{$>$} {$<$}msup{$>$} {$<$}mtext{$>$} m{$<$}/mtext{$>$} {$<$}mrow{$>$} {$<$}mo{$>-<$}/mo{$>$} {$<$}mn{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$>$} {$<$}/msup{$>$} {$<$}/mrow{$><$}annotation-xml encoding="application/xhtml+xml" name="alternate-representation"{$>$}{$<$}a href="https://static-content.springer.com/image/art\%3A10.1140\%2Fepjds17/MediaObjects/13688\_2012\_Article\_17\_IEq1\_HTML.gif" target="\_blank" rel="noopener"{$>$}Open image in new window{$<$}img src="https://static-content.springer.com/image/art\%3A10.1140\%2Fepjds17/MediaObjects/13688\_2012\_Article\_17\_IEq1\_HTML.gif" alt=""{$><$}/img{$><$}/a{$>$}{$<$}/annotation-xml{$><$}/semantics{$><$}/math{$>$} and confirm the appropriateness of our model.
